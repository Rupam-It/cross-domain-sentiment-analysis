Yes, the librarian character played by Marcia Gay Harden is stereotypical and played a bit heavy-handed. But the universal nature of the story, the beautiful setting, and the likability of the characters overcome this flaw. The quote at the end brought tears to my eyes.  If you want to take a break from Hollywood's standard fare of dark, violent, or stupid movies, then give this a try. It is is entertaining and thoughtful.	2015-08-31

It's a little hokey and this is not the best implementation of virtual sets I have ever seen, but I was surprised by the end of the show.

US	13726926	R23R9BFIL1PAZK	B013DS9GUK	825424463	The Salvation	Digital_Video_Download	3	0	2	N	Y	Visual Stunner	With a genre as saturated as the American western, it can be difficult to reinvigerate the brand. This film manages to do just that. Or does it? Revolving around the timeless and satisfying dynamic of the &#34;revenge tale&#34;, the movie runs in a fairly predictable pattern. The real character, and the real appeal of the film comes through in some spectacular cinemetography and visual effects. Detail has never been so looked after. From the costumes to the weapons to the set design, one never feels incomplete immersion. Casting was a pleasant surprise here. Mikkelsen plays his lead in the same sincere and intense manner that he always does. And there in may lie the secret here. The entire film smacks of a quiet desperation and some grim certainties that underscore frontier life in the western territories. All in all, there is little to detract from the action, save for the tired and ever staling idea that fossil fuel is the downfall of civilization. See There Will be Blood, etc. All in all, the film was well acted and nicely shot. Definitely worth a look, and must have on Blu-Ray or other HD format.	2015-08-31

It's not for everyone, but I get a kick out of him.  Debbie Reynolds absolutely makes this movie an enjoyable way to spend an hour and 44 minutes of your time.  It's slow to start but stick with it because once Miss Reynolds hits the screen, it becomes a truly wonderful film with lots of laughable moments...especially if you have older parents who struggle with technology, or acquire quirky habits like freezing every form of food under the sun.  I waited and waited for this film to become available on Amazon Prime but it never showed up.  So I finally bought a digital copy to keep in my collection and am so happy I did.	2015-08-31

While watching the trailer for this film it states that this is a documentary about a mans journey visiting Jamaica, once you rent the film it gives a small history of what you are about to see.  At this time it states that the film maker decided this material was to spiritual to share and he decided to put all of the content on the shelf.  Only about ten minutes of the film is with someone interviewing people about the haunted history of the island and the rest of the film is merely advertising another film project.	2015-08-31

Science fiction often asks us to examine worlds different from the one we know. It asks 'if then'? What if socialists win elections across the globe? What if Donald Trump wins in 2016, and is such an amazing leader, him and his brand of leadership serve as a guide for our nation, or perhaps the world, for generations to come? Just as often as it asks, 'if then', it asks, 'what if'? What if energy becomes completely free? What if cloning humans becomes as prevalent a trip to the local doctor? Many might recognize Sci Fi in it's creation of imaginary worlds that ask us to look upon our own world right now, presented in a different perspective, sometimes criticizing current society, or instead, some members in it.<br /><br />There were early or proto 'sci-fi' stories written as long ago as 2,000 years ago but it's been said science fiction as we know it didn't really (and couldn't really) exist until the 1900's when we became more aware of the larger world around us. It's a menace, a threat, a disease, or an ideology that threatens us all. After watching Battleship, I can't help but wonder if characters in the story have to save the whole world in order for it to Science fiction.<br /><br />Do the characters in Battleship save the world? With the speed in which aliens send five space ships to Earth after receiving a radio message from Earth, covering at bare minimum 10 light years distance, and their amazing ability to put up an energy shield covering all of Hawaii and a larger portion of ocean, it is a real question as to whether or not they'd send even more ships? The mystery of their other ships disappearance might mean something to them. Perhaps, though, for whatever reason, our navies did save the Earth.<br /><br />There's some question throughout the film whether or not the aliens are truly hostile, or whether they are merely trying to protect themselves and their mission as the film unwinds (although admittedly over reacting to us Earthlings - or did they under react to the threat we pose)?Quite often they let Earthlings go or be on their way if they do not consider them a threat. Are they going to eliminate or subjugate them later? Who knows, but why take any chances? One of the more interesting scenes in the film is shown from the perspective of one of the alien soldiers. It seems to be a memory or a flashback. We see him and his race at war with and being attacked by another alien race.<br /><br />The escalation to war, or at least fighting, is held out to be a metaphor for a fight between an American navy captain (the lead in the film) and his Korean rival. Our navy captain is punished quite severely for participating in the fight. It's an open question in the mind of the viewer through much of the film - is he being punished so hard because his opponent is Korean, or Asian? Throughout the film, especially the later parts, I couldn't help but see pop singer Rihanna, the female lead, in the role of mate to many of the different male characters (especially the extra pale guy with the buzz cut that often behaved kind of stupidly). The 'shells' being loaded and fired became quite interesting. I don't know what it was. It was a very intense movie. We can always hope they achieve contact. Battleship couldn't have been made without an interracial cast. Or at least it wouldn't have been as interesting - having only the action on screen to interest us.<br /><br />Overall it was a very entertaining film. Overall the plot made a lot of sense. Our victory over much more powerful aliens made a bit less sense. There were some breaks in the action, or explanations that went missing in the film (at what point did night fall and the Aliens somehow lose track of them)?  Battleship may have been cut or reduced in length. If so the film suffered a little bit because of it. Over all the film makes more sense if you consider that the aliens might not be completely hostile, or again, if they don't see us as much of an immediate threat to their selfish plans.<br /><br />One thing is certain, never send out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them. There, I just saved the world.nd out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them. There, I just saved the world.	2015-08-31

Because I wanted to understand the background of the characters and story, I decided to start with episode 1, season 1.  For an American TV series, this is exceptional.  Both main and supporting actors are first rate.  The main character, Alicia Florrick, is struggling with some horrendous family problems as she attempts to resume an interrupted law career.  Conflicts between her family life and career serve as a strong theme for the initial season.  Some episodes end in unexpected ways, while some end without a totally satisfying result.  This adds a strong element of realism to the show.  If you're looking for a thought-provoking show that will keep your interest, give this series strong consideration.	2015-08-31

Granted, the book upon which it is based has some pretty crazy stuff in it, but the show has gone off the rails and completely misses the point of the book. The novel, by the great Stephen King shares a lot of DNA with the Twilight Zone classic episode &#34;The Monsters are Due on Maple Street.&#34; In both, aliens mess with a slice of pure Americana (a suburban street, a small New England town), but don't really do much. They have an agenda, but they're very hands off in their methods. The point of each is that we don't need to worry about some alien menace. Under the right conditions, we become worse monsters than any extraterrestrial ones.<br /><br />That may have been the focus in the first season, but since then the show has gone into a crazy Invasion of the Body Snatchers Lite direction. It's pretty terrible.	2015-08-31

It's a blatant metaphor for the US/Mexican border and immigration issue, which probably accounts for it's less than amazing critic scores. This film has a heavy liberal bias, and I say that as a liberal myself. If you are strongly conservative and unable to separate your politics from your film-going experience, then this may not be your kind of film. If you could watch Avatar and still sympathize with the protagonists I think you'll be okay, but this issue strikes closer to home for some. I found the storytelling to be compelling and enjoyed the film very much.	2015-08-31

I am a huge fan of the original series, The Walking Dead, and was highly anticipating the newest entry into the Walking Dead universe. It did not disappoint. Even though as an avid fan of the original show and knowing from watching The Walking Dead, that this new series is headed for full scale zombie apocalypse (even though the characters don' know how or what is happening yet), Fear the Walking Dead still managed to create an exciting, nerve-wracking tension, that subtly increased throughout the series premier so that by the end of the first episode I was on the edge of my seat and craving more. Well done, AMC, Robert Kirkman, Gale Ann Herd and the rest of the team behind Fear the Walking Dead. I cannot wait to see where this series is headed!!	2015-08-31

It has a cast led by the amazing and well-chose Robert Carlyle, who pulls the rest of the actors up several levels in their performances.<br />The scripts are more adult and more realistic than the average potboiler, too - simple survival requires much intelligence when faced with almost incomprehensible technology and the terrifying hostile environment of deep space. No easy answers. Every scrap of knowledge requires a step into the unknown. And they don't even know where they are in the universe, let alone how to get home.<br />It's a huge, rich canvas for this skilled creative team. So why did it end early? Not because of flaws in the performances or production structure. It was due to SyFy's usual crappy promotion, and so the series ended long before it was out of story-telling potency.<br />Enjoy what's here. Eli is our Everyman.	2015-08-31

The first time I was caught off guard by the 1980s music and dancing, in a science fiction space story. It didn't seem to fit together.<br /><br />But this is a movie with a lot of heart. I love sci fi space opera, and also gentle spoofs of space opera like this movie. If you don't take it seriously it's a fun ride.	2015-08-31

I grew up watching the original B & W TV series on the BBC and loved it - so obviously did a 80's alternative indie band. I first watched this last year on a transatlantic flight from the UK back to the States. Enjoyed it then....loved it even more in the comfort of my own living room. The scenery is spectacular, the story line  is in keeping with the original but compressed for a single film. The performances are endearing and the denouement is quite gripping.

I find that Keira Knightley is always fun to watch, but Sam Rockwell steals the show here.  His quick retorts and verbal banter are the most entertaining aspect of the film.

Clearly, it should have been a made for TV movie but regardless, the movie had no real plot and was mostly just character exposition. I did enjoy seeing Mulder and Scully back together again, but the movie should have clearly had a bigger PLOT. I mean, I don't know what the writers were thinking. Why not have something to do with the so-called alien invasion that was supposed to have taken place in 2012?

IT''S THE JOURNEY	Rusty (Ed Helms) is grown and an airline pilot for a small airway. When the neighbors are over for dinner, he sees an enormous amount of father-son bonding, that he become envious and realizes his family is in a rut. He decides a vacation to Wally World (and not Paris) is what the family needs and announces to the audience &#34;The new vacation will stand on its own.&#34;<br /><br />His family is a bit dysfunctional.  We discover his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) was known as &#34;Debbie do anything&#34; in college. As a side note, I don't believe there is a Memphis State University, but the University of Memphis is a dry campus. Kevin (Steele Stebbins) the younger son swears excessively, wrestles, and likes to bully his older brother James. James (Skyler Gisondo) who &#34;doesn't have a vag.., but it would be okay if he did&#34;, keeps a wish diary.<br /><br />The film was funny. The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.<br /><br />Guide:  Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity.	2015-08-31

I've been a Hannibal fan since the Silence of The Lambs and he's about as good as Anthony Hopkins if not, dare I say better. With the same writers from season 1&2, I really hope someone picks this show up. I'd hate to see it finished so soon.	2015-08-31

I was anxiously waiting for Season 5 to become available and I was more than a little disappointed.  The plot seemed to take a bizarre turn with Bill & Erik and the Vampire Authority worshipping &#34;Lilith&#34; who was the &#34;orignal vampire.&#34;  This season seemed to focus less on Sookie's adventures and more on the Vampire League.  Alcide and the werewolves and the fairies were thrown in here and there but I missed Sookie!  It seemed as though too many things were going on at once and nothing was resolved.	2015-08-31

Loving the first movie, Divergent, I was super excited when the second one came out, Insurgent, I was super excited and read most of the second book prior to (although I didn't see it in the theater, I ran out of time) the second it came out, I RedBox'd it and after the first 30 minutes I was SOOOOO glad I had not wasted my money in the theater or bought it. The movie took out the most important parts skipping through what I thought was the whole reason behind the book which was to show how that certain faction was able to maintain its hippy type of go with the flow earthy behavior was because they were being drugged the whole time through the special tea ...... this came to light only after Tris was given the same tea and not being used to it, it had a over drugging loopy effect in her. The movie cut this whole section out and really ruined the whole movie.	2015-08-31

Nice movie about two gay brothers who have taken different paths in life and how they have come back together after years apart. Johnny Hazzard plays one brother who is outspoken, a major flirt, and a party type guy who does what he wants when he wants and to whomever. He is easy on the eyes and makes no bones about his sexuality. Mark Strano plays the other brother he is a homebody who has stayed in the family home and continued to run the family business. He is not the social butterfly, more protected and straight acting.  The two brothers find themselves back together as the fancy free brother is broke and homeless and needs somewhere to land and the more put together brother needs to open up himself more and be true to who he is.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully made movie about family and friendship, love and longing and the ghosts from the past. An an actor Johnny Hazzard has improved so much from his past roles in cheesy porn like soap operas such as The Lair, and knew to me at least Mark Strano could not have played a better character that many people can identify with.<br />Highly recommend this movie.	2015-08-31

A little slow and stilted at times.  Perhaps too much of the &#34;boys at home&#34; story for me.  I was more interested in the strategies that resulted in victory, and the backstory on how decisions were made.  This hopped from island to island to island and really did not show how victories were decisively won and the human cost of those victories on both sides. It also lacked any story line around how and why the troops moved from place to place.  They just got back on the ship and went to a new island-end of story.	2015-08-31

One little boy's love for his father transmutes into what he believes to be magical powers that can save him during WWII. After seeing his favorite matinee hero perform in their town he is convinced that he has the ability to bring his father home. Their priest, on the other hand, instructs Little Boy to perform a series of tasks instead. A sweet and funny tale that isn't overtly Christian but can be enjoyed by people of all faiths. Amazing performances by an amazing cast!	2015-08-31

Clint Eastwood plays a Secret Service agent who was guarding JFK in Dallas the day he was shot in 1963. He didn't take a bullet for the President. It's haunted his career and his life ever since.<br /><br />Fast forward 30 years and he gets sucked back into a Presidential protection detail when a rouge assassin (John Malkovich) goes insane and threatens the current president. It's all a game to Malkovich, who just wants to see if he's good enough. And he lures Eastwood into the game because he wants to go against the best.<br /><br />It's a cat and mouse game with high stakes.<br /><br />The acting is good.<br /><br />The story is great.<br /><br />It's just a good way to spend 2 hours.	2015-08-31

Overacted in various parts.  Not to be taken seriously and does no service to the sic-fi genre.  Ann Hathaway and Matt Damon as credible astro scientists? Mcconaughey delivers a decent performance.  Lithgow, C. Affleck, Burstyn gave best supporting roles.  The movie was more of an attempt to tug at the heart strings, which did deliver a cliche but moving scene with old Murph and her dad. The movie is way too long to sit through just to see some guy end up behind a library...ridiculous.	2015-08-31

I'm watching each episode of season 1 a second time before moving on to subsequent seasons.

Ali was the greatest both inside and outside of the ring. All Americans, and anyone anywhere that hold that freedom and human rights must be universal, should see this video. Ali was a moral giant with a stalwart internalized sense of right and wrong. He would not, and did not, bow down to a racist establishment power structure that offered odds vastly against him sustaining himself if he stood against it. He was willing to risk all of the fame and fortune that he had miraculously achieved, to suffer being barred from his profession forever if necessary, and even to go to jail. He intended to follow his spiritual/moral core beliefs no matter what. He did so and he paid dearly. He lost what many believed might have been his best 3 years in the ring when he was barred from fighting for that period of time, he had difficulty in making a living, he drew chagrin for being a black Muslim...but, when the smoke cleared he came off of the ropes victorious. This story is a salute to the human spirit of a true champion of the human race and I'm not referring to his superb boxing. His courage and dedication was an inspiration and to the benefit of<br />humanity. He was, and will remain, a true hero. Everyone should see this video. It should be mandatory in schools.	2015-08-31

I would have preferred a little more build up, so not only so we (the audience) could get to know them a little (and relate to them all more), but so they could get to know each other better too; making their interactions more believable.  Another minor problem I had was that the main character (warning minor spoiler) seemed to be very much a spectator in his own life.  This was quite evident in by him being illiterate even after being over 100 years old.  Except for being able to throw a baseball well, and having an encyclopedic knowledge about the sport, he seemed to have picked up no other skills, no wisdom, no charm, etc...  Otherwise it was entertaining enough but a little slow with much left unexplained.  The overall pace and style reminded me very much of Let the Right One In (or Let Me In if you want the other version) but not quite as good.	2015-08-31

When I watch it she is with me and I feel her happiness and know she is in peace! I am deeply grateful that Amazon has instant videos for us to enjoy. It is soo very much worth the price! The only thing I wish which could be different is that the rental lasted for 48 hours instead of only 24. Sadly, I feel a deeeeppp, intense amount of pressure to watch whatever I have paid to rent. But, other than that I love being able to watch stuff I cannot seem to stop thinking about and longing for! I have loved the King and I since I was a small child. This movie is a part of how I was raised. It shall forever be a part of my heart. Way to go MOM!!	2015-08-31

I am a comically jaded viewer, so it isn't easy for a show to make me actually laugh out loud let alone bring me to tears and split sides. This show does it for me, consistently. It's not just the low-view gems that they find on youtube and worldstar that make this show, Rob Dyrdek's comedy and presentation sends this show over the top into absolute hilarity. The guests they have are very hit or miss and the other two people on the show are alright, but it's all about Rob and the videos that some poor person finds while scouring through the depths of youtube. Buy it.	2015-08-31

This movie was recommended by a USC Film teacher through the USC-KAFE program in L.A.. So, I decided to watch it and it was good. There was lots of mystery about who had killed a local girl. The Mother actress Joon-ho Bong son is being accused of killing the local girl and goes to jail. The Mother goes on a quest to find the murderer to get her son out of jail. But there is a twist her son is mentally challenged and this makes it challenging, when he can't remember what happened the night of the murder. It does have an ending twist and you must watch the movie!!!!	2015-08-31

It's so real for a number of reasons.  The people are REAL people, the characters ring true.  The boys and their friendship portrays the essence of teen friendships everywhere, the sense of angst, of hope for the future.  It feels like it is a true-life love song to Northern Maine, which I think Aron and Gita, being Maine residents, capture so realistically.	2015-08-31

There was so many times that I wished that I could throttle him for his chauvinistic behavior and just being a douche. The main guy...I think his name is Tim or something, he was a jerk and annoying as well. His acting was not believable at all and seemed forced.  The only characters that I liked were Harold, Chad and Julie.  This movie could have been better, but they didn't care to make it better.  The end scene didn't make much sense.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to be annoyed.  It just proves that there aren't any truly scary movies anymore.	2015-08-31

I've read a bunch of reviews of season 2, and they are all true, from the 1-stars to the 5-stars.  It's true that initially Molly didn't seem very ______ over the ______ of _____, that there is too much ___ compared to Season 1 which was more ______-friendly, that _____'s personality seemed to change rather abruptly and in an unwelcome fashion.  And there's definitely some sci-fi ____ going on.  And one thing I didn't read, somehow Molly seems to think that it's always her _________ to do things and that is a bit unbelievable.<br /><br />However, the plot is so compelling and fabulous and _unpredictable_ that I can just barely wait from when it is broadcast on Wednesday to when it is released on Amazon on Sunday to avoid all the commercials.  The show continues to surprise.  It's a delight.  I hope it renews for Season __!	2015-08-31

When the neighbors are over for dinner, he sees an enormous amount of father-son bonding, that he become envious and realizes his family is in a rut. He decides a vacation to Wally World (and not Paris) is what the family needs and announces to the audience &#34;The new vacation will stand on its own.&#34;<br /><br />His family is a bit dysfunctional.  We discover his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) was known as &#34;Debbie do anything&#34; in college. As a side note, I don't believe there is a Memphis State University, but the University of Memphis is a dry campus. Kevin (Steele Stebbins) the younger son swears excessively, wrestles, and likes to bully his older brother James. James (Skyler Gisondo) who &#34;doesn't have a vag.., but it would be okay if he did&#34;, keeps a wish diary.<br /><br />The film was funny. The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.<br /><br />Guide:  Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity.	2015-08-31

The heartache and challenges of the family are just as engaging as those of the 'clients' he is attempting to help. The main character's conflict of belief and commitment to a 'promise to god' made at an agonizing point in his life, is compelling. I was fully invested in the characters through every episode of Season 1 and I do want to know what happens in Season 2.  I am glad this popped up on my Prime recommendations.  I had not heard of this series and Benjamin Bratt is pretty darn good in the lead role.	2015-08-31

A great example of an extinct style of animation: Rotoscope. Watch with context. This film was way ahead of its time. The movie paved the way for many films, including Peter Jacksons LOTR trilogy. Jackson will never admit it, but he used many of Bakshis scenes to block out his camera and action for the live action trilogy.<br />Too bad Bakshi ran out of money.

The issues regarding the abysmal state of the US media and news circus are real and high time that a player such as HBO has stepped up to the plate. The show's personal stories, tho', suck royally and belong on midday soaps.<br />The direction is competent, if unoriginal. Good production values.<br /><br />The writing is too wordy, not giving the viewer enough time to consider the issues and take them outside the show and into the real world.<br /><br />Acting is fair to good. Mortimer is terrible, and comes across as a lachrymose bimbo largely because of the writers' inability to divest themselves from the TV soapy format. Guys: get a day job and work, or try working, for a female executive. But first get steel tempered underwear. The Jane Fonda character is the most grown up of the lot. I expect that she may've had a clause in her contract to shape her role more to her excellent commonsensical grasp of reality. Daniels character is equally formulaic, i.e., boring. Charismatically boring.<br /><br />Bottom line: good show with lots of room for improvement. This show should be an inspiration, instead of a nice way to kill time.	2015-08-31

There are some inaccuracies in the story and the costumes are lavish but again some minor mistakes here and there which does not detract from the movie plot or story. It is decent story of the beginning of the Roman Empire	2015-08-31

I was stunned at how many people handled the corpses without gloves on.  The Allies forced the local townspeople that lived near the camps to walk through the camps to see the atrocities committed by their government.  These people walked in smiling; different story on the way out.  Some fainted, some got sick and the rest were absolutely horrified seeing the piles of corpses, starving people near death and even furniture made of human skin!  This is a must watch for those that are holocaust deniers.	2015-08-31

Everyone agrees, I think, that this is a terrific &#34;prequel&#34; to a terrific series. Shaun Evans makes it, though his mentor, Thursday, is a huge assist. Season 2, Episode 3 was the best of the first two seasons. The season finale went a trifle over the top. But the writing is generally superb and I can't wait for the third season. Best British detective series since Foyle's War.	2015-08-31

It is raw and brutal. The hatred of opposing sides is felt and seen. The evolution from new guy to loss of innocence to war-torn veteran. It shows a lot of scenes that not even Band of Brothers perfectly captured. Toggling &#34;the switch&#34; between seeing a buddy killed, but also having to stay in the fight until it's over. Very well done movie. (Reference: fought in Iraq 2006, 2007, 2008)	2015-08-31

It is not sensationalized speculation about aliens or conspiracies. Rather, each episode takes a subject and walks you through what happens to it in the museum, behind the scenes. There is a little getting-to-know the people there but its not a reality television thing at all. I think there is something for everyone here, as this is not a subject that is covered much. Not sure if this was/is PBS but it could almost be. Oh and if you want to relax this is great. No excitement but interesting enough that it will not put you to sleep.	2015-08-31

So this film definitely isn't for everybody, but if you're tired of formulaic hollywood &#34;indie&#34; films and want something dry, weird, and lo-fi, this is solid gold. It's funny in a dark, deadpan way, with a nihilistic vibe and a little bit of violence. Overall, this is the most original indie film I've seen in several years.	2015-08-31

THIS IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE. 90% of the film consisted of an expressionless Ryan Gosling gazing at....stuff. As for his other scenes, I envision a scenario in which the director instructed Gosling to express the absolute least amount of emotion possible in every single scene. It appears to be a film meant to impress people who make films rather than for people who enjoy them. Watching this film was PAINFULLY, PAINFULLY BORING. That this film is boring cannot be emphasized enough.	2015-08-31

It is a comedy so plays a bit to the stereotypical politician.  Some good humor and a few good laughs.  But the interesting thing to me is how accurately it portrays a few of the shallower types I have met in this business having been involved off and on interacting with my State government political types.  In some cases it is spot on which should be a scary thing to those that are not involved up close with them.	2015-08-31

Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?	2015-08-31

At times it was a little hard to catch several  of the fast spoken UK idioms, which called for a bit of rewinding, but overall the cast is engaging and very funny without being too sweet. Yet one can see the potential for a very loving relationship growing, and a great many laughs to come as this bumbling couple become parents.<br />We hope the show continues to run, looking forward to Season 2.	2015-08-31

For the dancer, it is essential and great to hear Suki and Merrill talk about instruction that Balanchine had given them as dancers, Suki is delightful although her French accent can be hard to understand as she rattles ballet terms. The moves are also demonstrated by students who later became company dancers. For the ballet aficionado like myself, these tapes have provided me with a wealth of information about jumps that I failed to get from books. In the two volumes, the jumps are divided into five sections: one foot to one foot, one foot to two feet, two feet to one foot, etc. I saw Meryl dance (always wonderfully) many times and it is a treat to see her demonstrate that technique that made her in her time an unequally fast dancer. Definitely 5 stars and if I could I would give Merrill and Suki many hugs.	2015-08-31

Melinda does show too much skin but producers seem to think that is what sells it seems.  I like the way she helps spirits resolve their problems so they can cross over.  It would be nice to be able to give people left behind a wake up call that the possibility of ghosts is maybe what they need to find closure.  This may be one of the first shows that has enough entertainment and not just selling a product out there.  I really like being able to view the episodes without annoying commercial ads blasting my ear drums.	2015-08-31

When they thought the world was flat, a Greek fisherman takes a Princess back to Atlantis which is on the verge of attacking the rest of the world with their superior weapons.  But corruption abounds in Atlantis, and that continent is on the verge of extinction.  The fisherman falls in love with the Atlantis Princess and is determined to save her from Atlantis' destruction... The film is dated, but enjoyable entertainment if you extend your imagination.  It's a pleasant, enjoyable film.	2015-08-31

Issues of race, family relationships, the position/s of women, and legalities verses moral integrities in the 18th century unfold organically and are confronted by authentic textured characters who are based in fact.<br />Society and historical context are displayed within the confines of a tightly written script, beautifully realized by artistic technical collaboration, headed by a director of imaginative vision, passionate loving heart, and a deft guiiding hand.<br />What's portrayed in this film is only one of the specific worlds that benefited and thrived during the long world history of black enslavement. It is a pretty world, for those on top of course, and we are not really shown &#34;slavery&#34; as experienced in another recent film dealing with a similar theme, Twelve Years A Slave. The sweep of Belle offers the audience a different tone, wider issues.  It's view of slavery is just as horrific as slavery is in Twelve Years A Slave, but its particular and also very specific points are made in quieter ways--at least for this viewer.<br />Both films hit home and are most satisfying, in their own good and different ways.<br />It's great to see a black woman leading a period piece, too.<br />Belle is a beautiful film and is one that I will watch again.	2015-08-31

Why are all of these 30-year-olds still in high school? Aside from that, it was a touchy-feely film that tried way too hard to relate to today's high school students. The moral of the story is that you'll always be better off just being a nice person. The message was too simple to justify a 45 minute story. A younger audience might not see the flaws and be entertained by the premise.	2015-08-31

In some ways it was great but it also limited their direction. They had still had diversion stories and they did it very well. It was just no longer a week to week toss up. I'm in the middle of watching it for the 2nd time and still think it is awesome. They have more syncs to their characters which didn't need to happen but did make it even more interesting.	2015-08-31

Hayden Christensen plays a total jerk who wakes up one day to find that nearly everyone in the world has vanished, and the days grow shorter and the nights increasingly longer. Worse yet, the shadows are alive and are trying kill everyone. On paper, Vanishing on 7th Street sounds like a sure fire win for a horror movie. It plays on the natural fear of the dark many people have, has plenty of mystery that keeps you engaged, and it has a fairly solid cast with the likes of Christensen (who shouldn't be judged by the poor script he had in the Star Wars prequels), Thandie Newton, and John Leguizamo.<br /><br />Sadly, while the film does have some decent scares and manages to maintain some level of tension. It never fully achieves the potential it sets itself up for. Between hokey CGI shadow effects, hackneyed usage of true historical mysteries with easy explanations that blow the film's supposed explanation out of the water, and truly stupid character decisions the film feels more like a bad Doctor Who episode (and given that show actually had an episode about killer shadows that was AMAZING makes this film look all the more worse). Add onto that, a truly stupid ending with obvious biblical undertones and a shot that rips off the iconic image of The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes riding his horse down an abandoned highway and you have the mediocre strawberry on a truly disappointing cake.<br /><br />Not to mention, it's way too easy to make &#34;Dark side of the force&#34; jokes throughout the entire film's run time. I strongly recommend watching this movie with your friends and seeing who can come up with the best Dark Side pun.	2015-08-31

I loved the storyline however the plot took too long to unfold.  For me the connection between the final confrontation and rescue of Cass was weak.

This film has non-stop exciting action and all sorts of improbable but enjoyable situations. I felt that one regular cast member who has grown along with the rest of the cast as the series has evolved was dispensed with too readily, but otherwise a great film, outstanding cast, excellent cinematography and direction. This will definitely please fans of the Fast and Furious franchise and the hot rod, speed movie genre. This film has lots of fun and excitement and is OK for families with older kids to watch. There is no profanity that I can recall but lots of violence, although it has an ethereal quality. This is the most durable, bulletproof family of hot-rodders you will ever meet. Spellbinding special effects and touching tribute to the late Paul Walker, a talented artist who left us much too soon. Filmmaking gold.	2015-08-31

Plus, I've never seen so many famous guest appearances in one show.  They parade the A-lister actors in and out of different episodes which, of course, the show's format allows since they're always fighting a battle in court, good-guy vs. bad guy.  What startles me the most (SPOILER ALERT!) is why they would remove one of the headliners...?  We'll see how that balance develops, but overall, it's a good show with enough action and intelligence to keep you glued.	2015-08-31

They do get the job done and they do it better then anyone else in the Quad.	In the far future the system known as the Quad is ruled by the Nine Families and their subsidiary companies that maintain and keep order throughout the worlds.  However one such company know as the RAC or Reclamation Agency Company or just &#34;The Company&#34; by those employed by it.  What they are bounty hunters or &#34;Killjoys&#34; who go after targets wanted for all manner of crimes against the Quad.  SOme are wanted dead, alive it doesn't matter so long as the Killjoys follow the warrant and complete it.  For failure will result in a warrant out for them.  And how do these Killjoys maintain such  loyalty among so many powerful factions?  Simple they swear loyalty to the Company and only the company. To those that work for it and stay out the way of those that would rule the Quad.<br />  We follow one such team of Dutch and John.  Together they tackle every case with ease.  Dutch a level five Killjoy and John a level four they get the job done.  That is until John discovers that his own older brother is wanted dead by someone high up in the world for reasons unknown.  What was a simple job just became far more dangerous.  As John's brother D'avin is  on his own search for someone who did something so terrible it is blocked from his mind.  Together the three of them team up and collect the creds and the info they need to stay one step ahead of those who would see them dead.	2015-08-31

Very powerful piece of science fiction way, way ahead of its time.  With all the plastic surgery today and the ability of medicine to manipulate one's appearance, this was clearly a look into the future in 1966 when this film was made.  The only things I did not like about the movie was the cinematography and the careless editing of some scenes where a pillow disappears when Rock Hudson is in the plane.  Also, did not care about the hippie scene where they are making wine.  These non actors did not add anything to the movie plot.	2015-08-31

An accident occurred on stage were Charlie was hung. Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler)  joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.<br /><br />The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films.  We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming. I liked it. The problem I had with the twist is that there is a &#34;discovery&#34; of things that happened 20 years ago, secrets I didn't think would exist in a small town where everybody knows everyone's business.<br /><br />Guide: 1 whispered F-bomb.

This is supposed to be about the battle for the Kall Trail, part of the horrendous Battle of the Huertgen Forest in 1944. That was a very interesting, bloody conflict. However, in the movie, the terrain is all wrong (the Kall trail is a steep trail down into a deep ravine where it crosses a little stream before rising back up a steep trail--in the movie it looks like the Rio Grande), the tactics are from the trenches of WWI, not WWII (the soldiers all stand up together and slowly walk on line to get slaughtered), and the weapons are ridiculous (the German 88 and tanks are direct fire weapons, not artillery).<br />Not sure how making this movie with just a tiny bit of historical accuracy would have been so difficult. Is it because the writers/producers/directors are stupid, or because they are lazy, or because they actually do want to portray the past incorrectly?	2015-08-31

I watched this series on local tv a couple years ago and always regreted that they cancelled the transmission. Now that it is available on Prime videos I'm glad I could watch it daily. The series is good overall, it is mostly focused on the Reagan family which has a tradition of being cops for several generations. I think the series is successful in showing how our lives and the way we live it could lead people to committing crimes or being victims as well.<br /><br />I watch an episode on a daily basis and I'm already thinking of what will happen when I watch the last episode, I guess I'll miss it as you miss an old friend.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2015-08-31

Although I like this for its characters and their interactions, I am tiring of everyone (the lawyers) filing charges when they feel slighted.

The ongoing plot line is very well done although the writers somehow dropped the ball when the main character (Mike Ross) and his girlfriend attempt to elude an attempt at blackmailing by the managing partner by having the girlfriend move to California. The changes her mind but the threat against Ross never materializes.	2015-08-31

Anyone who can make a movie out of two shower stalls and some blinking lights is amazing. I guess they left off the ending either for a squeal or just to exercise your imagination.  My wife would not watch because she instantly labeled it science fiction after seeing the blinking lights. It is fiction in as much as theoretical quantum mechanics is just that.  Not many special effects and a little over acting. I will stop before I provide any spoilers.	2015-08-31

If you are over 18 this film will not work for you. I turned from Stephen Greenblatt's book, &#34;Swerve&#34; for a break but this film lacks swerve, lacks a solid script and experienced enough actors to bring it off.  The parents are nicely played, always loving, always fun but the script isn't heavy enough for novice actors to &#34;create&#34; weight enough and lift their burden as creators to the level of art. The &#34;swervy&#34; conclusion, unfortunately, does not justify the hour or so investment getting there. It's an old gimmick captured years ago in a better way by Ambrose Bierce's &#34;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.&#34;	2015-08-31

This is one very good action movie. I enjoyed it very much. Why it was not a box office hit is a wonder to me. It has all the ingredients. I suppose the aroma of the Stallone stinker of the 90's followed this movie, jinxing its box office potential. Total shame this is a really good movie. Not a remake of the Stallone movie, an entirely new one. I at first thought it was gonna be a remake and almost didn't rent it. I am glad I did, and not only that I decided to buy it. It really is that good. BUT...forewarned. It is extremely violent. And gory. I also think that the movie would have been even better had the violence and gore been toned down a bit.	2015-08-31

It really ended playing an almost &#34;good vs. evil&#34;. Certain characters seemed as though they would be insignificant and yet made for an entertaining event. The reunion show illustrated that it was not simply a matter of editing but that some of these characters truly were just as you saw them in each episode. The challenges were well crafted and Gabon made for a beautiful setting.	2015-08-31

A hard-nosed, hard-hitting newspaper reporter who liked his liquor, liked his women, liked to live close to the edge on a story, hell was willing to go over the top six ways to Sunday in order to sell the bossâ€™s newspapers (and he was not particular about which boss as long as he go that by-line, got that big fat check). Get this too was willing, way more than willing to throw the truth out with bath water in order to keep the story humming for a few extra days, or until the juice was sucked out of the damn thing. Of course guys (gals too but our protagonist is a guy on this one) like our boy, Chuck, Chuck Tatum, maybe you read his by-line when he was riding the big wave, who live for wine, women, song and a big chunk of fame have a habit over going over the edge a little too much for the city editors of most newspapers taste which has caused him to be thrown off half the best newspapers in the country.<br /><br />As we hone in on the story line Chuck is cooling his heels out in Albuquerque, on some nowhere square dink newspaper where the editor/owner thinks you should tell the truth straight and without the garnish, funny guy right. Finds himself out there where the states are square and the people left to their own resources by their own choice had better treat one another square, and be square or else. So our big city reporter was just looking for that one little story to ride him back to the big time, to easy street, what the heck maybe to that Pulitzer Prize that has eluded him all these years.<br /><br />And lo and behold out in the middle of Podunk on his way to cover yet another hoe-down or picnic in the boondocks Chuck gets his lucky break, a story a real live human interest story, the kind that people stop whatever they are doing to follow, the one that has them on the phone telling one and all their exact opinion of what is happening, with baited breathe. Here is the beauty of this one, a guy, a regular Joe (although his name is Leo but nobody cares about the name as much as the one-on-one human interest about what is happening to some poor sap who is in more trouble than they are, not much more was caught in a cave looking for relics around the mountains which the local Indians, oops Native Americans, you know the native peoples and needs help getting out, help which in the normal scheme of events would take a few hours and done. Except our boy Chuck smelled this for a million dollar story anyway you cut it, a story that every poor sucker who reads the newspapers form Podunk to New Jack City could relate to, if he can keep the thing alive long enough to draw an audience. So the catch is too get the guy out, but not too some. Through some very devious methods and some pure high-handed power-plays Chuck shows his reckless expertise, gets so wrapped up in the thing that he can see the bright lights of the city as fast  as he can write, and finagle things so that he gets exclusives, the almighty exclusives that separate the pros from the amateurs in the newspaper business. The key though was to keep that story going and that is where everything turned to dross in the end. See Chuck ordered the rescue crews to do the rescuing of poor sap Leo the long way round, you know, to keep the story going, has the crowds attracted by his stories coming out to observe the human drama in person on edge, has made the whole thing a  media circus. Key to that was getting Leo tough/hard as nails/sexy snake of a wife to work the ropes with him. And she, Lorraine, like all blonde Lorraines played her part well once our boy Chuck who, frankly, seemed to have been hard on his women, got under her skin (and gave her the franchise in the gathering circus end of the game). Of course there was a down side to Chuckâ€™s scheming since Leo refused to cooperate by getting a little short of breath waiting for that longway around digging to get to him, yeah the poor guy  folded up under the cave-in pressure and didnâ€™t last long enough to get the big headline. Great big fifteen minutes of fame story if there ever was one.<br /><br />Sounds like any other news story of today 24/7/367 media frenzy of the moment though, right. Wrong this is the skinny, the real skinny this one came in 1951. This one is famed director Billy Wilderâ€™s (he the super-max daddy director of the close up sordid underbelly look at old time Hollywood in Sunset Boulevard) Ace In The Hole as he takes a big swing at the newspaper business in the days when that medium ruled the roost of mass communication and when like today with the expansive social media mega-reach the notion of â€œall the news that fit to printâ€ hinged on how many paper it would sell. Kirk Douglas as the cranky, over-the-top news hound Chuck gives a very good performance here as does Jan Sterling as Lorraine, that hustling wife of poor old Leo. Hey, I didnâ€™t tell you the ending, the real ending not poor schmuck Leoâ€™s running out of air but Chuckâ€™s. In the end Chuck got â€œreligionâ€ (helped by a friendly mortal wound from Lorraine when he decided one more time to play rough with her), see before he too passed from the scene he realized that he had gone over the edge, had set something in motive better left to the fates. Yeah, thatâ€™s the real cautionary tale sixty some years later.	2015-08-31

I am a huge Jane Austen fan and also enjoy P.D. James and read Death Comes to Pemberley. I so looked forward to the Masterpiece Theater version of the book - recorded all three hours and then sat down for an enjoyable marathon. About 15 minutes (make that 10 minutes) into the first episode, I stopped watching and have since deleted the episodes. I will not be purchasing the DVD's. The casting of Elizabeth was just wrong. Where was our &#34;loveliest, dearest Elizabeth&#34; with fine eyes, a lively wit and light step. I admit that this is not an intelligent critique of the series, of course, as I did not watch it. If you can get past the casting of Elizabeth, as I could not, you may enjoy these DVD's. I will contine to watch my Jennifer Ehle, Keira Knightly and Elizabeth Garve versions of Pride & Prejudice.	2015-08-31

After reading the Hiaasen book (Strip Tease), I was curious about the movie version of the story. While I believe that any movie version cannot reflect favorably all of the background and details of its book form, this movie, in particular did not weave the plot together seamlessly (coherently). If you are not seduced by the visions of the lovely topless Demi Moore, or the Burt Reynold's whacky interpretation of Congressman Dave Dilbeck, you will not find this film compelling. I really think this is about a 2.5.	2015-08-31

I haven't read the book, but I sure hope it's better than the movie was. Judy Blume has an excellent reputation as a YA writer, so I would expect more of her than what came through in this movie. I found it contrived and cliched, as well as inaccurate. The Jewish funeral at the beginning, for the protagonist's father, was ridiculously inaccurate. Kaddish is recited at the graveside, not Shema. The Native American ritual was likewise built on stereotype and very little knowledge of authentic tradition. &#34;Wolf,&#34; whom &#34;Tiger&#34; meets just too conveniently pops up at very contrived moments, and his father being in the hospital is just too precious and absurd. The characters are one-dimensional and cardboard. Even the small touches (a young girl climbs up a mountain in New Mexico and doesn't rip her jeans or get her hands dirty?), are poorly done.<br /><br />I can see where the end has healing and moving qualities. Perhaps my standards are a little high, as I am an adult and the movie was meant for teenagers or &#34;tween&#34;-agers. But any age group deserves the respect of accuracy when depicting religious traditions and rituals, and some complexity in the characters.	2015-08-31

This is a fun, very humorous, love story that was overlooked by the critics.  Set mainly within Provence, France at a beautiful chateau with scenes from London, Russell Crowe does a great job as an actor.  He is a funny, outrageous, smart, egocentric romantic who finds himself at a crossroad between his business life in London and a laid back style in Provence.  He is supported by Albert Finney, Marion Cotillard, Archie Punjabi, and Didier Bourdon, all of whom do a wonderful job.  The story swaps between the past and the present, giving impetus as to why two people who forgot they met as children, grow up in different cultures, and fall in love.  I rarely watch a movie more than once, but this one I enjoy watching it again and again with my family and wife.	2015-08-31

My next best/favorite movies are a toss up between the original Star Wars trilogy, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Harry Potter series. All frivolous compared to this movie. This one shows what CAN be done with a master film maker at the helm.<br /><br />It is not a movie you will want to watch repeatedly or often. About every ten to fifteenth years might be right. I've seen it twice, once when it first came out, in the theater, and later on DVD. And that is enough for me. It is a &#34;heavy hit,&#34; but a movie everyone should see at least once.	2015-08-31

There isn't a compelling storyline.  It's very predictable as things are telegraphed way ahead of time.  The violence is gratuitously graphic.  I know the era and the characters would be violent but it seems that many of the scenes are used not to move the story on but to impress the audience with the special effects...spattering blood, etc. Yeah, this guy got killed, you gained nothing by drawing it out.  The story isn't that interesting and the characters aren't likable so why should I keep watching beyond the four episodes I gave it to get interesting.	2015-08-31

Much better than I expected	I liked this movie.  It is based on a true story from the mid 1750's in Pennsylvania.  The movie did not have a wide theatrical release so I did not expect a lot from the production.  The acting and production quality was much better than I expected for an independent release without a sizeable budget.  I am not getting into the &#34;politics&#34; of the historical events but appreciated the faith based portrayal of the immigrant family who left their home in Europe to practice their faith in a new land free from religious persecution.	2015-08-31

It has humor, a bit of sadness, and a great story - this should appeal to many. I don't want to reveal the plot, but I will say its about a secret society that works to save the world, only invites &#34;exceptional&#34; youngsters in when old members die, and there's a mad-man out to destroy the world as we know it - and the new class has to learn and deal with this threat as current members are being killed. This movie has<br />1) a bit of Get Smart, although its much more intelligent than that (and I loved Get Smart when I was a kid);<br />2)a bit of Bond, but it is much more self deprecating than that; and<br />3) even a bit of Justice League thrown in, but much more sinister than that.<br /><br />A great Sunday afternoon film with great actors taking on interesting and well developed characters.	2015-08-31

It has a distinctly adult flavor--given its sexual aspect.  But it doesn't go over the top with it.  It's entertaining enough that I kept watching despite the feeling that, at times, I might overdose on the sweetness.  Just as I felt I was approaching saturation, the REAL people showed up.  You know.  The ones with warts--just like the rest of us.  That was a relief.  I must admit it did have just a bit of that &#34;stiffness&#34; I always feel at the start of a new series.  But given how much I liked it, I am expecting GREAT things when the actors are feeling more at home in their roles.  And I anticipate it will not disappoint.	2015-08-31

Susan Oliver is one of my favorite actresses of all time, A true pioneer in so many ways. Classic beauty that rivaled the best Hollywood had to offer, on the Big Screen or Television. She will stand the test of time.  I remember watching TV back when I was young in the 70's and always wondering who this beauty was, I had such a huge crush and she was so prolific.  Now 52 I am now rediscovering Susan all over again. The bravery she possessed being only the 4th woman ever to fly solo across the Atlantic took nerves of steel and courage beyond belief. So talented!!  I wish she was still alive so I could tell her, but she's looking down and knows. A great role model to all!! Susan set her mark and stuck to it! Great documentary for anyone who treasures the golden years of Television.  George Pappy did a fabulous job!!  Sincerely, John Ferro in FLA	2015-08-31

Dick's original novel appears to be alive and well in this excellent pilot.	I read the late Philip K Dick's original novel the year I graduated from High School (1978) and have been waiting to reread it, but now that novel has been turned into a series for at least one season, I'll have to reread The Man in the High Castle before the season begins in November 2015.  From this pilot, I can see that many changes have been made, but they were necessary if the basic premise is to be presented as a series that might run multiple seasons.  Pop radio in this alternative 1962 sounds like from the 1940s in the Nazi-occupied portion of the former USA.  Thus, Rock and Roll never got going, and I suspect there will be no Beatlemania in this alternative timeline's 1964.<br /><br />Yes, and I sure hope I got caught in the Pacific States of America, which is the same way I felt after reading the novel so many years ago.  My teenage boys and I are looking forward to watching the coming season.  Nazi technology versus Japanese wisdom plus the Chinese I Ching should be a delightful secondary subplot, as we learn more about the Man in the High Castle and whether or not he can remain safe from the those who would like to see him silenced.  Guess who won World War II in the original novel, as determined by the I Ching.  We're looking forward to see what the producer will do with that plot element.	2015-08-31

Very well done, good cinematography, good costumes great acting and a likely more realistic view of what the people were like, the bickering that took place just like today and how this country was really formed.

He also wanted to abolish slavery in the document, Southern states wouldn't have signed it and we wouldn't have the country we have today. Competing economic interests just like today.

Most of the events recorded in &#34;Greek Mythology&#34; are scientifically true by location and person, however the things they have said to have done have been put in metaphors or over glorified. This movie Hercules never says the stories are true of what he's done, and everyone says what is true is he's done good deeds and saved so and so people. I think it is a brilliant aspect on the myth.	2015-08-31

So is there any way for me to turn in my US citizenship for Canadian. I do not use drugs. The closest is taking Adderall for ADHD. And really I do not want to. But so much that was said, especially what was not drug related is what frustrates me and shames me about being American. The arrogance of the US stampeding across other countries, ignoring their sovereignty. The US just takes and does whatever it wants. The arrogance of the US. The unwillingness to look at other examples and possibilities like they were saying about not looking to Europe. The hypocrisy. I want to move to Canada and trade on my US citizenship for Canadian.<br />I also do think drugs should be legal. I don't want to use them, never cared for them. But between the horrors of the drug war and the horror of personal violations. The idea that I can have a substance in my home and am not harming another person but the police can barge into my home uninvited is terrifying. Funny thing is this attitude is even unIslamic. People talk of Islam being oppressive and yet the laws of the US l are more so. Mind you many Muslim countries do not follow the laws of Islam correctly. But Islam is clear that what you do in private in your home is between you and God. There is even a story of a Muslim leader who heard singing and entered a man's home catch g him drinking alcohol. But the man then pointed out that while this leader had caught him doing on wrong thing the leader had done three by entering his home from the back not the front, entering without grating and entering without permission.<br />Alcohol is more dangerous. Smoking is more dangerous. The war on drugs is more dangerous than drugs. The entire thing is moronic and needs to be changed	2015-08-31

I suspect that this is a modernized version.  In this movie, which takes place in modern times.  The Greystokes own a large corporation that specializes in energy production. Mother & Father Greystoke are in Africa with their son trying to find an, as of yet, untapped source of energy.  Their helicopter crashes into the side of a remote ravine.  The only survivor is Tarzan who is found and cared for by a gorilla.  Time passes and Tarzan eventually becomes the ruler of the gorillas.  Greystoke Industries continues to search for the energy source and comes back into contact with Tarzan.<br /><br />I don't think the movie is bad.  The animation is ok.  The plot is fairly straight forward.  The problem is the Disney version of Tarzan is so good and entrenched in my memory that this one just can't compare on any level.  You watch and think, &#34;Hmm, OK, that's done.&#34;, when it's over.	2015-08-31

Out of curiosity I watch it  and found it somewhat dated.  Remarkable amount of nudity and violence for that era. It's a bit slow in parts.  The late Dennis Hooper is as strange as ever.

The Turtle's personalities are interesting but Shredder is campy and stupid weird. Splinter is bizarre to watch. As a fan from the early 90's Ninja Turtles I was not impressed. Raph however was done pretty well, I liked when he called Vernon a &#34;human nerd&#34;.	2015-08-31

My entire family loves this show, including my 10 y/o!	My entire family, from 10 years old to myself at 45, absolutely LOVE this show. It is one of a series of fantastic shows put out by the SYFY network. We are starting it for the second time, due to the duration of time between its initial release and the release of the last season which just came out. It is exciting, interesting, intriguing, and sometimes even a bit cheeky. However it has something for everyone, and I would encourage everyone to try it out. After 5 episodes, you will be hooked!	2015-08-31

Great writing, acting and I'd go so far as to say, it was one of the best series I have ever seen.  Character driven, with richness beyond description.  By the end, I was sobbing and had run through every emotion available.  I definitely recommend this series! Like a great book, you will miss these characters, long after it's over.	2015-08-31

This was a combination of Ole Yella meets Betty Ford !  This is one more attempt from Hollywood to make us think that odd balls of society are the ruling factor.  A woman who has been widowed and retired for 20 years and drinks her lunch- decides to start smoking pot out of boredom and hasn't been out at night in 2 decades  is not something we need to aspire to !!!! Its a sad case of one wasting a life and not something that deserves a movie.  As far as the Director of this depression feast - are they truly getting that lazy that they no longer attempt a sound track or any form of background setting and the dinner scene was almost laughable !! ?? This is so dull and quite it is like watch a bad reality show ........ so the message is .....once your husband dies you hunker in the house with a case a wine?? NICE MESSAGE !  I would call this a case of &#34; A Conscious Uncoupling Of Talent&#34; !!!!	2015-08-31

When I compare this show to something similar done on US television, this UK production tells the story without all the extra drama and gimmicks found in U.S. Shows.

For the first time in my 69 years, I'm reading &#34;Last of the Mohicans.&#34; Remembering there was a film, we decided to watch it, so as to have a visual while reading.<br />The photography is great. The casting and acting were great. But, I was particularly struck by the dissimilarities between the book and the film. Here is what they have in common:<br />Hawkeye and his two confederates; the Colonel and his daughters; the major, and the antagonist, Magua, were in both.<br />The plot of the movie was somewhat similar to that of the book, but enough different as to create wonder if they were intended to represent the same work. The beginning, middle and end of the movie were all different from the book.<br />Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but J. F. Cooper would not recognize it as his.	2015-08-31

CGI graphics had just come out when this was made. The movie's climax is nothing but the characters staring at the special effects for ten minutes. This is not the movie's fault, but more a symptom of changing times.<br /><br />Life in general moves much faster today. The Internet makes most human knowledge available at the click of a button now, whereas back then one had to travel to the library and look in the card catalog and find a reference book. We microwave our TV dinners now in five minutes, instead of putting them in the oven for 45 minutes.<br /><br />That said, I still enjoyed seeing Leonard Nimoy alive and well. Rest in peace, Leonard.<br /><br />My husband Googled the actress who played this bald character and were shocked to discover she is dead, too. She died in the late 1990s in her early 50s. really sad. And it hit home because we're in our early 50s now.<br /><br />We also looked up the captain-turned commander who played her love interest and were amused to find out he played a minor part in Falling Skies. We plan on checking out those two episodes again soon, this time knowing where we've seen him before.<br /><br />And of course, there's William Shatner, always fun to see as Captain Kirk. I met him last summer at PACCON. It was one of my biggest fangirl moments ever. :)<br /><br />Love the original Star Trek TV series, which is never this boring. They didn't need special effects to make it exciting, either. Instead, the original series had excellent dialogue and pacing.<br /><br />Bottom line: This film relies too heavily on CGI graphics, which are no longer interesting in and of themselves.	2015-08-31

I've read it so often that I practically have it memorized.  Jackson's &#34;adaptation&#34; of the story in all three of these movies strips the magic and the majesty from the story to fit a commercial plot line.<br /><br />So very much that was vital to the emotional impact of Tolkien's vision was removed and replaced by pablum.  Too much that was never in the books was added, and all of Jackson's additions detract from the tale.<br /><br />Every time I see even a short snippet of Jackson's movies, I feel angry.<br /><br />The CGI is good, so two stars - but only to the programmers.  This is a sad maladaptation of an epic tale and Jackson has no shame.	2015-08-31

Rather a low-key character, but, as always, likeable.<br />Worricker manages to charm his way through life, helping people and being kind -<br />very unlike what you might expect from a spy.<br />But practical and rather sensible when it comes to reality.<br />We really enjoyed the wit and subtle humor.	2015-08-31

Doesn't say anything in this movie.  I don't buy this guy's brooding stiffness you see what I'm sayin'? There's no human element to his character so you wonder how he has friends or love interests or anything.  He's trying so hard to seem like a tough guy, but he comes off as mild-to moderately autistic, not sociopathic.  Gosling goes for TOO mysterious to the point that it doesn't even make sense. And the director made this movie TOO stylized.  I don't buy this movie's stylized pop violence thing that it's trying to do.  Leave that stuff to Quentin Tarantino.  Trying way too hard.  Real bad movie.	2015-08-31

Our lives have all had a time where we felt we needed to get away and find our own truth. My only complaint is the audio is terrible. Most of the time when the main character is reciting something or reliving a life event you cannot hear what is being said. Then when she is in town or talking with another person the sound comes up and you have to turn it down. I had to have the remote in hand through the whole movie. It was very frustrating. I probably missed 25% or more of the dialog because of the erratic audio.	2015-08-31

I know it's supposed to be scary and suspenseful, but the lighting was terrible - it was so dark I couldn't tell what was going on, so I was never remotely scared...more like confused. And honestly, the lighting didn't make any sense! You are sitting in a dark room and hear a creepy noise...what do you do? 99% of the population is going to turn on the darn light to see what made the noise. These people, however, just keep walking around in the dark house, trying to figure it out. Silly.	2015-08-31

The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.	2015-08-31

For the dancer, it is essential and great to hear Suki and Merrill talk about instruction that Balanchine had given them as dancers, Suki is delightful although her French accent can be hard to understand as she rattles ballet terms. The moves are also demonstrated by students who later became company dancers. For the ballet aficionado like myself, these tapes have provided me with a wealth of information about jumps that I failed to get from books. In the two volumes, the jumps are divided into five sections: one foot to one foot, one foot to two feet, two feet to one foot, etc. I saw Meryl dance (always wonderfully) many times and it is a treat to see her demonstrate that technique that made her in her time an unequally fast dancer. Definitely 5 stars and if I could I would give Merrill and Suki many hugs.	2015-08-31

Jimmy Sisto, who developed the screenplay, is the older, more passionate (and disreputable) &#34;Alpha&#34; brother - David Walton his tightly wrapped sibling, a substitute teacher with a student minion, Joshua Rush. Initially nursing old grudges, they fight their way through qualifying tournaments (and a brief scuffle) as their relationship evolves from thinly veiled hostility to fraternal affection. The humor is mostly subtle, although Sisco laces his character's lines with plenty of F bombs. Amy Smart and J.K. Simmons are major supporting characters, but off court interaction between them and the two brothers is slow paced when contrasted with the realistic looking on-court action scenes.  A serious tennis fan or player (which I am not) would probably enjoy it much more than I did.	2015-08-31

Chicago Code has good scripts, a very good cast, excellent use of Chicago locations and smart direction.  The Fox network has somebody working for them that can pick good properties.  I would have enjoyed seeing another 2-3 years of episodes.  Unfortunately, the network also has somebody who doesn't see the value of staying with and supporting a good property.  It's not the first time Fox has cut loose a good show.	2015-08-31

The story never really happened. It just &#34;was&#34; - I was very disappointed, especially in Emma Stone's character. When I see movies like this, I often wonder about the people who do the editing - are they too involved in the movie to see that it makes no sense after they get through with it? I was 45 minutes into it before I understood what was going on - I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but the people I watched it with were just as clueless as I was.	2015-08-31

The history lesson itself is a FIVE Star Story.  I am a retired US Navy Master Chief and served 30 years (1966-1996), yet never heard of USS Mason (DE-529) and her all African American Crew during WWII. This is a story that needs telling, unfortunately this movie doesn't do it very well.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre at best and that may be doe to a poorly written story or just bad production.  I struggled through the movie, more like a documentary really, and a poor documentary at that. I would give the acting, production, and overall movie a two to three star rating, but I did like the overall story and its impact, so 4 stars.	2015-08-31

It has a top notch A list cast, good director, but the way it was written was very poor.  I am not sure what was worse, the way it was written, or how it was put together post production.  Most good stories have 3 acts, beginning, middle, and end. This had one long beginning that crashed into and ending in the last 15 min.  Character setup dragged for the entire movie. You could not tell if it was a homicide at time, a drama, or romantic flick. Any conflict in the movie was muted, and it just dragged on.  If it would have been better written and directed it could have been a great movie.	2015-08-31

I watched the first 2 seasons of the Fosters on Netflix so when I reached the end of Season 2, I switched over to Amazon for Season 3. I really love this series- as an extended Kin raising Kin family parent myself, it is fascinating. Throw in that the dynamics of a cop mom and a vice principle other mom (the parents are Lesbians), referred to as &#34;The Mom's&#34; makes for a very captivating series. I was a little confused by Jesus's disappearance, it is a little strange- I will have to go back and watch the way it comes down in the last episode of season 2 and the first of 3.<br />For some reason Amazon isn't offering a buy the whole season deal on this so I have been buying as I go, kind of a pain but I savor each episode that much more as I approach running out of them.	2015-08-31

A decent movie that felt like fan service to Adam Carolla fans and given that this was crowd funded by people who most likely like Carolla and his comedy it makes sense. For the most part, you can pick out many Carolla tropes that have played out over the years on his former radio show and current podcast. There isn't much in the terms of new material, which isn't bad if you are new to Carolla and enjoy that kind of humor, but if you are someone like myself who has listened to Carolla since the Loveline days on KROQ, the radio show on KLSX, and the podcast, then it can feel a little repetitive. It also has vibes from his previous theatrical release, [[ASIN:B003UOL6G0 The Hammer]], some of which have been matured and refined.  It's tough to be critical about this movie, as I am a Carolla fan, but the truth is that Adam is a great comedian with a quick wit that is best appreciated as he pulls up quick one liners and funny comebacks in back and forths with guests on his shows, but as a scripted actor he comes off dry. I couldn't help but think many times while watching this film, that it would have been better with another lead. Many of the comedic and romantic parts wouldn't have come off so stiffly, and the movie might have flowed better. Overall, it is a fun movie, and has some great high points, but to be a greater success, Carolla may need to stick with his strong suit of writing and get out of the camera to give someone else a chance to deliver his unique brand of comedy so that a greater audience can come to love it the way many of his fans have.	2015-08-31

The common thread of doing something that is worth doing well takes time is really, well, entertaining and thought provoking.

In the end the workers are executed by being shot by having to lie on their stomachs on the grass. The girl who survived the gas is forced to run away but she's shot as well-she's the one who narrates the story in the end (it's a voice-over).	2015-08-31

The clarity is very good, and the video retains a soft film/grain-like appearance so there isn't any overprocessing to make things too sharp or too perfect.  I'm streaming on a Vizio M55-C2 4K TV with calibration settings adjusted for great black levels/etc.  I was very impressed with the picture quality.  Some HD options really aren't that great of an upgrade from the standard definition component, but I definitely felt this one is a good watch.  Amazon has had this title on sale previously for $7.99.  So, if they take it off of Prime soon, and I feel the need to watch it, then I will not feel bad about paying $7.99 or $9.99 to have the HD version as it is good quality.	2015-08-31

I watched this film on Amazon prime .  I passed ov er it for some others, but kept being drawn back to it.  I originally thought it would be the typical trite and predictable narrative of mother and child.  I was so wrong!  This is so heart wrenching and loving on many levels.  I've watched it several times and see more each time.  I'm considering ordering DVDs for my grown children and grandchildren for Christmas.  There are so many emotions without loud gunfire or ridiculous superheros and violence.  There is so much kindness and love from all the characters minus one.  I highly recommend this for everyone except young children due to a brief moment of vulgar language from only one character.	2015-08-31

It's a very unusual movie as where the main character is actually not exactly the heroic type. He's not a coward by any means but at the same time he's in no great hurry to see any more action or risk his own life by doing so. However due the shortage of men, sergeants and officers he has no choice but to accept two field promotions which of course put him in the position to command troops. Once forced back into action he does do his best to keep inexperienced troops safe and does see much more combat. It's hard to review a movie without giving away much of the plot especially the ending so I won't say any more about that. This movie is based on a true story about a bloody and perhaps little known battle that took place after the Normandy invasion. Both sides stated that it was senseless to even fight this battle as it held no strategic meaning at all even if higher command felt it did. It's gritty and graphic, well acted, scenery is great, equipment, weapons etc as realistic as possible. I love a movie that takes your right into it from the beginning and that's what this movie does. From start to finish you find yourself trying to understand the main character while liking and perhaps disliking him at the same time. This is a very good movie and the fact that's it's based on reality makes it even better and more enjoyable to watch.	2015-08-31

The storyline and script seemed like it was written by a grade schooler. The synopsis states '....accidentally prints out a DNA code that in the wrong hands can end the human race'. Nowhere is this stated in the movie, never mind expanded upon, you really don't know why the 'bad guys' are even after it. Bad script, bad acting, circumstances and events that just aren't believable - an example: 'hero' is driving to save daughter, stops for gas, gas station attendant - an old fat guy recognizes the hero on TV as being wanted by the police, hero goes to get in his car and leave - but the attendant has the keys and sticks tongue out at the hero. Instead of grabbing the keys, clocking the attendant, and ripping out the phone, this guy takes off running toward a destination we are led to believe is still miles away - while the gas station attendant calmly calls the police. This scene is actually worse when you watch it. Don't be drawn into the 'X-File' like cover art, that really is where any similarity ends. The 'Riff Trax' / MST3K crew could have a field day with this one.....	2015-08-31

The lead character, Sydney, is an alcoholic, chain smoking, carousing priest who partners with a an alcoholic, chain smoking detective to solve crimes. Social themes are presented anachronistically in the 1950's setting, with the tolerance that is expected in 2015. The two voices of propriety are an overly stern house keeper and a mousy curate with no confidence.<br />It's unfortunate that a potentially good show is ruined by depressing themes. If Sydney's character does not turn sharply for the better and stay there, we won't be watching season 2.	2015-08-31

So I started watching it and  watched all six seasons straight through... I just couldn't stop!  It was delightful!  Wholesome, sweet, old-fashioned, sentimental....all the things that are missing in today's entertainment world.  Yes, it was sappy and not very well acted, but who cares.... It was perfect escape fare...something we need more and more in today's difficult, complicated and often disturbing world!  If you want to truly escape....this is your ticket!!!

I have watched this movie as a teenager and wanted to show it to my wife and our 6-year old boy. The movie contained an off-putting amount of bad language (with adults, as well as kids, using words like &#34;s--t,&#34; etc!), meanness and kids screaming at each other, racial stereotypes, etc. Our son was quite scared of the evil crooks, a dead body found by the kids in the walk-in freezer, and the screaming person chained to a chair in the basement. After giving the movie ~25 minutes' chance, we unanimously decided to turn it off. Perhaps we'll try again in a few years, but even for adults this was hard to watch!...<br /><br />We love the beautiful Astoria, OR. Hated the movie.	2015-08-31

This not really a groundbreaking idea, but the movie did make me stop and think about my priorities. Ultimately though the movie offered little beyond that, as their examples of happy people were a woman in Denmark who moved into a commune, a man who gave up his life to take care of the terminally ill in Kolkata, India, and an excruciatingly long sequence of elderly women in Okinawa, Japan who were happy because they met each other regularly, lived off the land, and took care of each other's grandchildren. Obviously nobody is going to be in these extreme situations, I wish the movie had focused more on how average people had improved their happiness. The other message was that surrounding yourself with family constantly would improve your happiness, but I can't stand most of my family members, so what do you do then? Movie had a lot promise, but ultimately delivered an overly simplistic message. Needed more depth, and more realistic examples of how people could improve.	2015-08-31

It is really sad how much influence the packaged and junk food lobby has on our system, and this film makes that clear.

The plot - British hopes of using the best of British cuisine to heal and guide lives through difficult times - is an admirable and touching one.

It ended up being added to the list of interesting looking movies I never got around to seeing.  Big mistake.  Ex Machina turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen all year.  The premise is fascinating yet simple - An employee of a large computer company wins a week long stay at the companies founders retreat.  The company founder is a legendary genius who has dropped off the grid to work on some secret project.  The project turns out to be artificial intelligence.  His creation is the lovely looking machine like creation seen in the advertisements, so I'm not giving anything away.  The premise then is turned on it's ear as we are taken into the relationships which are formed between the creator, the employee, and the creation.  It is a testament to the acting and filmmaking that your beliefs and alliances get all tangled up and twisted.  Some people may be put off by a concern the movie will be too technical or highbrow.  While it does have its moments, there was never a point where it went too far and lost the viewer.  It is not at all like &#34;2001 A Space Odyssey&#34;.  That movie has always been a divisive wrestling match between people.  This movie instead manages to be thoughtful and thought provoking without going over the top.  The ending comes with a surprise twist, and it is perfect.  It is not at all contrived to make things fit into a neat little box.  The cinematography is wonderful - claustrophobic, foreboding, yet beautiful.  The juxtaposition between nature and technology are all around, and it all adds to the mood of the film.  Extremely well done and inspired.  Although it probably will be forgotten around Oscar time, the set design is fantastic.  There is swearing, drinking, and nudity, none of which is gratuitous.  Highly recommended.	2015-08-31

The script was poor, and disappointing. They could have done so much more with the story line. It was way too predictable. Scarlett's character made a single radical change from interesting self-directed, street-wise young adult woman to scary monster, and that was it. Abuse of her powers made her scary but why would using more of her brain not result in increased compassion for others, seeing the interconnectedness of all things, and mellowing out? That doesn't make sense. The moral seems to be that we're better off being brain crippled at 10% brain use than waking up the rest of our supposed potential, because there is nothing but nastiness inside of the human skull.	2015-08-31

It felt more like a good student film than a major production. Except for the very first scene, the whole thing felt cheap and choppy. Even the incidental music was poorly (I.e., too often) used. The story is good enough -- setting up what's about to come. Acting was mixed.<br /><br />It's impossible for me not to compare this to the Walking Dead pilot -- and the WD pilot was vastly superior on nearly all counts. I'll watch the second episode of FTWD in hopes of improvement.	2015-08-31

SPOILER (this is the opening scene):<br /><br />The camera pans up and across the crest of a small rise.

Into this scene rides some German (officer?) on a white horse leisurely clip clopping along.  &#34;Do-dee-do-dee-do, just out for a morning ride.  Good thing we must have cleared this battlefield and pushed the Americans way back so I can just plod along here with no real purpose or concern.  Nothing to worry about here.&#34;  &#34;Iii-eeeee!!!!&#34;  From out of the shadows of the top of the Sherman, a wild man vaults onto the horseman, propels them both to the ground, and then stabs the horseman deep into the eye as the camera goes in for a closeup.  After pulling his knife out, we see the ambusher is none other than Brad Pitt.  He mumbles some stuff, pats the horse on the head and then hops back on the Sherman and climbs in.  We quickly discern his tank was disabled in the battle and the crew is hiding inside trying to get it fixed.  Good thing Brad took care of the only person on either side curious about how the battle came out or these guys might be in a world of trouble.<br /><br />A few war crimes presented as standard operating procedure, some more odd events, and multiple f-bombs later, we get to an improbable battle at the end and we're done - bringing it all artistically together by showing a white horse again.	2015-08-31

Full of holes in logic and action scenes that defy the laws of physics. The dialogue sounds like it's written by a third grader, and the fight scenes appears even less feasible/realistic than those in the WWE. All in all, everything a Fast & Furious movie should be!

It also could have benefited from more (female) nudity. In contrast to the subdued, restrained pitch of the story-line, more casual nudity by the female cast would spice things up a nit more. The brief nudity in the film was done in a cheerful, playful manner. More of that would have added more contrast and flavor.	2015-08-31

The divine costumes of rich fabrics. The beautiful gardens and scenery.  Great story.  Great acting.  Great escape from daily reality.  Great rainy day home alone kind of movie to watch so you can immerse yourself in the story.<br /><br />John Malkovich is the perfect insidious bad guy - soft spoken, manipulative, & completely evil. So good at being evil you'll still hate him when the movie ends. :D	2015-08-31

It's a neat idea where they were trying to take it, but the way it played out didn't sit well with me. Almost seemed like the last two episodes were written by a completely different team than the rest of the series and weren't nearly as good. I wish they'd have continued with the Greek mythology, and maybe followed the stories a little better--that would definitely have made it more interesting to me.	2015-08-31

So the age difference I didn't think would creep me out in this movie, but it really did.  Couldn't they find an actress who didn't look so young.  The dynamic of the two lead actresses just did not work.  The older character acted more like her mom which was so gross.  The movie was also highly predictable which was another drawback.  I would save your money and watch &#34;Loving Annabelle&#34; instead.	2015-08-31

Now, if the acting could be as good as the script. Some wonderful moments were lost by the wooden performance of Redford (he was out of he element in a dramatic role) and the lightweight Jennifer Lopez. Morgan Freeman was, well, Morgan Freeman and his performance in a role that seemed written for his large cinematic persona was predictable. But the weight he brings to any role made the others pale by comparison. Decca Gardner (as Griff) has better days ahead as she grows into her acting ability.<br /><br />Josh Lucas did as much as he could with a limited character of Sherif Curtis, and Damian Lewis as the abusive boyfriend was appropriately malevolent and not too over the top, which is easy to do in that role. Carmen Manheim was, again, over her head in an otherwise fairly simply role.<br /><br />I haven't read the book but the screenplay teased out the storyline in a way that kept me interested (despite the acting) and surprised at points. There were a few forced story threads (making a to-do out of forgiving the bear that mauled and crippled you)...but don't know if it was better told in the book than the movie.<br /><br />In all, I wouldn't watch it again but there was enough to enjoy in the first viewing.	2015-08-31

Any version is a good version when it comes to Jane Austen. What I especially love is each production's varied portrayal of the nature of respectful behavior, the temperament of the parents, and the level of severity expressed in breaches of social etiquette or moral behaviors. This version seems to me to have a more  &#34;down to earth&#34; quality as compared to the more recent ethereal ( K. Knightley?) production.  Costumes and Mr Firth such a delight to view. Each character feels true and well defined as to be able to have a conversation. Get out your tea and scones! Enjoy!	2015-08-31

Song of the Sea is an absolutely gorgeous animated film that is equally enchanting, adorable, and heartbreaking.<br /><br />I remember when Big Hero 6 won the 2015 Oscar for Best Animated Film, and I remember there was an overwhelming gnashing of teeth from people who were all, &#34;What even? It wasn't that good!&#34; and I, not having seen Song of the Sea (or Boxtrolls, or Kaguya), was thinking that they were a bunch of sore losers and that Big Hero 6, even with its flaws, was a great movie with fun characters, quick plot, and good lessons, and deserved the win.<br /><br />After I watched Song of the Sea, I found myself in the camp of teeth gnashers. It's not that Big Hero 6 isn't a good movie, Song of the Sea is simply a BETTER one.<br /><br />The same storybook style that was so intriguing in the Secret of the Kells has evolved into something transcendent in Song of the Sea. The characters are very relatable even if you are not familiar with the Irish backdrop and the inheritance of Irish folklore that runs through this film's veins (heaven knows I was a bit lost with all that talk of Tir Na Nog and giants and fairies). The main character is a little boy who loses his mother on the night his sister is born. The loss breaks his father and induces the paternal grandmother to try and get the kids to stay with her, in the city, instead of on their little lighthouse island. We see how much the little boy resents his sister, and though it's clear that it's unjustified--she's a sweet, curious, and quiet little girl--we still can't help but sympathize with him a bit. This starting point makes his subsequent physical journey as he tries to get back to his lighthouse home from his grandma's house in the city, and the emotional growth as he finally confronts the wounds in his heart and tries to find closure to a tragedy, all the more substantial. You see real character development, and it happens in such a natural, organic way (even with all the fairies and owls about).<br/><br />Put it this way--the movie's ending is heartbreaking, whether you read too deeply into the symbolism of it or not. But it's also strangely uplifting, as though the whole movie is meant to be heartbreaking, until the very end, when sadness becomes acceptance, and acceptance into joy at a new day.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film to both children and adults. I'm not sure who would cry more: mom and dad, or the kids. My husband and I blubbered quite a bit at some points, but it was cathartic in its own way, so I'll consider it a bonus. I fully intend to add this movie to my hardcopy collection; it really is that good. Better than an inflatable robot hero.	2015-08-31

The show is smart funny, and compelling and most of the acting is great.  The problem with Sorkin's writing is that it is so quick paced and intelligent, that often the wit is lost not just on the audience but at times even the actors doing the work.  It can be hard to follow.  I am a huge fan of The West Wing but The Newsroom, because it is on HBO, is able to bring a bit more reality to the interactions between its characters and that much is better than The West Wing.<br />If you like compelling drama and quick wit as well as superb acting by the likes of Jeff Daniels, Emily Mortimer, Sam Watterson, and Jane Fonda, check out this show.	2015-08-31

This movie really sticks to its motif, which ultimately pays off.  Everyone and their mother has made a horror movie so it takes a lot to push the genre forward. Although I don't think this film will see the same genre-shaping effects of the found footage craze that Blair Witch spurred, the film's primary device (viewing the events of the film in real-time, through the monitor of one of the characters) works well and feels fresh.<br /><br />If you are worried that the cinematic device will get old, don't.  The truth is that it does, but you may find that it doesn't matter. Having it established early on give the viewer more permission to focus on the plot elements, and ignore the narrative devices used to communicate them.  This was a silly, ambition and fun movie.  I might actually recommend watching it on your own laptop in a dark room with friend.	2015-08-31

I wanted to like this from the description and seeing Samuel Jackson in it.  It looked like an adventure feel-good movie.  This was a waste of time and money.  It looked like a film commission movie from Norway.  The pace was slow and the story undeveloped.  The complete lack of any attempt to be realistic was lost.  US forces having an armada of helicopters on foreign soil sent in by our situation room that could not track a plane and generals that just hung their heads low while civilians yelled at them.

The arc of her portrayal of an attorney learning how to operate and navigate in a justice system that is presented as flawed, where sometimes the defense attorneys have to represent the bad guys, is very well executed.  Her character has developed in surprising ways from the beginning of this series.  It is a testament to Ms. Margulies acting abilities that she pulls this off so effortlessly.  It's an enjoyable, and distracting, series, it will keep you engaged, especially if you like intrigue, where you're not sure what side to stand on, or whether the facts matter, or not...  Tastefully executed.  And, the character wears killer outfits!	2015-08-31

Even if the total cost ended up as high as $3M, that's still a paltry sum for a movie that requires shoots in semi-remote locations, special effects in numerous scenes, and the creation of specialized sets, props, and costumes. The 1st Hobbit flick (2012) had an estimated budget of $180M, which is maybe 60-150x the price tag of MQH. Was the 1st Hobbit flick 100x better than MQH? Not by a longshot. That said, don't buy into MQH if you expect anywhere near Peter Jackson quality, obviously.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />âœ” Cinematography. Waaaay better than expected. Not super-creative, but someone knew what they were doing behind a camera.<br />âœ” Locations. Utah is not only a poor man's New Zealand, it's a fairly spectacular place to shoot this genre.<br />âœ” Actors. Christopher Robin Miller (Hammerhead), Adam Johnson (Thane) and Nicola Posener (Teela) have numerous previous credits to their names, and relative newcomer Melanie Stone (Marek) did an admirable job as the lead. Thane was added to the story in a clever manner and remained likable; Marek and Teela are foxy without wearing clich&eacute;d skimpy high fantasy garb.<br />âœ” The soundtrack. Yeah, it's a bit high-flown for a B movie, but it's surprisingly inspired.<br />âœ” Special effects / CGI. Yes, I'm on record here as saying the effects were decent *given the budgetary constraints*<br />âœ” No dragon.

If the news actually aspired to this level of intelligence, it might actually be worth watching. Instead, far more pften than not, we get sensationalist nonsense that some advertising-addled producer's test group said would drive numbers.<br /><br />An FYI for all of that stupidity out there: sure, we commoners love watching train wrecks happenning in slow motion in other people's lives; it is legal heroin. But we shouldn't want this drivel. And you, Mr. News, put your ethical decripitude on display every time you feed our addiction.<br /><br />... So yeah, I suppose you could say I like the show, &#34;The Newsroom.&#34;	2015-08-31

I enjoyed the book of The Outsiders and realize that when a movie is made, changes sometimes happen to tighten the story.  This cut features extra footage, none of which enhances the movie.  Music has been added to quiet reflective moments, overpowering the dialogue.  Some scenes were even replaced with different takes than those included in the theatrical release.  The film quality is also poor.  Horrible.	2015-08-31

Well, it was a kind of guilty pleasure.  the old fellow in the beard could barely contain his contempt for the Holy Catholic Church.  My favorite line was his insistence that the Vikings attacked England repeatedly not out of a desire to enrich themselves, but out of a desire to curb Catholicism.  Well, I think we all owe the Vikings a big dam' apology!  It was really great fun in view of the fact that he fervently believed everything he said, but it was badly made and even I can only stand so much.

I've been watching most of this series, primarily because the basic plot is so interesting; and I'd like to see how it all gets resolved.  However, I think the dialogue is often just unrealistic, not what any normal person would say in similar circumstances; and the acting is mediocre, I mean better than I could do, but not top notch.  So I'd really like to fast forward to the end, and do quite often.  It also feels like the writers/producers are saying, &#34;We've got a hit here; we need to extend the plot out as long as we can to keep it going.&#34;  I can't say as I blame them; but, again, I might just wait until I hear that the final episode is posted on Amazon, and watch that one.	2015-08-31

As a hobby gardener who loves the English cottage garden look, I was inspired by the obvious love and dedication that produced all these gardens. Some videos of this sort are dull, but the short interviews with the English gardeners - all hobbyists like myself - made it so much more charming and entertaining. I thought it was just the right length, too: long enough to make you feel you really saw and appreciated each garden, but not so long that you ever get bored. Also, the choice of gardens was excellent. No repetition or sameness. Very well done!	2015-08-31

US	12100376	RWWCU57SV00MX	B000YHB7TC	419093123	Final Destination	Digital_Video_Download	4	1	1	N	N	The movie will keep you at the edge of your seat.  An excellent B movie.	FINAL DESTINATION is a color movie taking place in the present era.  The plot concerns a group of high school students taking an overseas field trip to France.  The high school students are accompanied by two adult teachers.  During the first half hour, the students gather in an airplane terminal and board the plane.  Then, one of the students takes a nap and has a dream where a latch handle falls of from the flip-down table at his seat, where the plane then starts shaking, where oxygen masks all are released into the passenger compartment, where a fire starts inside the cabin, where a chunk of the wall blows out and a passenger is sucked out of her seat into the atmosphere, and where the plane crashes.  Then, the student wakes up from his awful dream, and tugs on the latch handle, and it falls off just like in his dream.  Then, the student realizes that this is a harbinger of the airplane crash.  At this point, the plane has not yet taken off.  The student (Devon Sawa) raises and alarm and rushes out of the airplane, and a handful of the other students join him and leave the airplane.  The group of students watch the airplane take off from the runway, and they are shocked when they see the airplane blow up in mid-air.  The remaining hour of the movie concerns the notion that the fate of each of the surviving students is somehow predetermined, and that each of the surviving students will soon die.  Two agents from the FBI spend this remaining  hour tailing the student.  The actors playing the FBI agents are very good, and this aspect of the plot adds a further dimension of suspense to the plot.<br /><br />Much of the movie concerns the role of fate in killing off the surviving students and the surviving teacher.  Because of the somewhat repetitive aspects of this portion of the plot, it might be reasonable to characterize FINAL DESTINATION as a &#34;B movie.&#34;  But it is a good movie, and it provides food for thought regarding the concept of pre-destination.  Theending of this movie is not really a distinct one.  The plot just sort of withers away suddenly.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS.  The special effects are excellent.  The tilting and shaking of the airplane, as depicted in the student's dream, is excellent.  The fire and explosion where a chunk of the wall is blown out, is very realistic looking.  After the airplane sequence, much of the rest of the movie shows electric sparks, tumbling kitchen knives the plunge into a schoolteacher's chest, and fires caused by spilled alcoholic beverages.  These are all realistic.<br /><br />TWENTY TWO.  The closest story that I know to FINAL DESTINATION is a Twilight Zone episode called, Twenty Two.  Twenty Two stars Barbara Nichols, who is a nightclub dancer experiencing mental exhaustion.  She is in a hospital receiving care for her exhaustion, when one of the hospital employees (Arlene Martel) who works in the hospital's morgue says to Barbara Nichols, &#34;Room for one more, honey.&#34;  Arlene Martel (who is more like a spirit than a real person) also provides a warning to Barbara Nichols, right before boarding an airplane.  Barbara Nichols decides to return to the terminal, and from the terminal she sees the airplane blowing up.  Hence, in my opinion, watching Twenty Two will enhance your enjoyment and appreciation of FINAL DESTINATION.  Another Twilight Zone episode should also be mentioned.  This is PRIVATE CHANNEL from the color Twilight Zone episodes, from 1986-1987.  PRIVATE CHANNEL is just as excellent as TWENTY TWO, but since it is of more recent cinematographic vintage, it is the case the the acting in PRIVATE CHANNEL has much more pizzazz.  Scott Coffey plays the starring role, as man about 18 to 22 years old, who acquires a premonition that his airplane will crash.  Scott Coffey ends up saving all the passengers of a jet plane (including himself) from a bomb.  To repeat, both of these Twilight Zone episodes have a plot similar to that in FINAL DESTINATION, and will likely enhance your enjoyment of FINAL DESTINATION.	2015-08-31

It seems to get a little preachy, especially at the end, concerning CIA ethics (or lack thereof).  Ethan Hawke did a great job making me believe he was grizzled savvy vet pilot.	2015-08-31

Season 1 was great, season 2 was ok, but at this point I am only sticking around to find out the meaning of the dome itself. What attracted me to this show was the breakdown and rebuilding of a society during a disaster, and the possible supernatural tie-in. Season 2, I forgave, because most sophomore seasons are exposition-laden, wobbly and never really as good as the first. Season 3... Well, this season was very painful to watch. The dialogue was predictable and uninspired (Dean Norris, you have been robbed!), and the plot is super messy. It's as if the point of this season was to render all of season 2 moot, by essentially getting rid of characters and story lines that were prominent in it (what was the point of the Melanie character at all? Or Junior's Mom and that damn red door?) and using a warped-time line to force the plot into some other crazy direction.<br /><br />It seems the &#34;in thing&#34; to kill off main characters in shows these days, which is something I applaud: in my belief, the story should come first, not the actors' contracts or network's pocketbooks. But there are 3 deaths in the first two episodes that just didn't even need to happen. The story didn't move forward, or anywhere, because of those deaths. And, as a woman, I am against woman-shaming, but Marg Helgnberger's lips need some serious fixing. That's all I can think about in her scenes, and she has so very many scenes! SPOILER ALERT: I am only sticking around because I heard the dome comes down this season. With one episode left, it better!  I don't think I'll be back to watch this next year. Stephen King, you've disappointed me here, but I will buy the book. It has to be a million times better than the show!<br /><br />9/8/15 Update: yay! They are putting this show out of it's misery!	2015-08-31

So far, this gets a 5 star rating in my book. I love how we get to see how it all went down those few weeks that Rick was in the coma. The character development is there, and yes, it starts off slow, but I would expect nothing less. We are seeing the collapse of society and what happens in the weeks leading up to Rick waking up from a coma. The internet, power, cell towers ect are all starting to be internment, and you can't help but wonder when that fails completely. I, for one, can't wait to see what happens to our characters. This is a brilliant spin off, and I hope we get a few season out of this. It will be nice to see a different side to the end of the world.	2015-08-31

The writing was poor and some of the lines were very cheesy. The idea was interesting though, and I felt there was a story there, just not well told. I was among a long line of girlfriends that decided to go out and watch 50 Shades when it came out in theater to see how Hollywood had adapted the story on screen. I was actually very impressed! My husband didn't like the movie AT ALL and couldn't understand why any female would be interested in being abused. I think that is what made me like the movie though. It really did a good job of showing the main characters being torn between several conflicting ideas of right and wrong, desire, sex, and control. They were vulnerable. Also, Hollywood didn't downplay the issue of BDSM going too far and what it does to someone not ready to be submissive. Lastly, I liked that the movie had a lot of comic relief. The story needing to be told could get very awkward and very heavy and the author made the characters come to life well.	2015-08-31

The story line followed the original marginally if you think about it.<br />Lets take and nit pick a few things.<br />First the alien ship. In the original John Carpenter movie, they used the Footage from the original 1950â€™s version where they uncover the ship using explosives. The ship was out side when they found it uncovered with thermite if I remember correctly. This version has them finding it in an ice cave. Albeit that might be a bit more realistic considering enough explosives to uncover a ship of that size would have taken up a lot more space on the ice. But simply put, they changed that part. Lets not forget that the fact is that they were using computer graphics in this movie that werenâ€™t available to the people during the time period. Creative licensing is ok, but if this is the prequel to the first movie, continuity please. Then there is the poor explanations for the various deaths that Kirk Douglasâ€™s character found when he and the doctor for the original movie showed up. To easy.<br />It was a good movie effects wise, but to those of us out there that really enjoyed the original when we were kids. It lacked. If you havenâ€™t seen the original yet. See this first, and understand that the original was made in the 1970â€™s. Otherwise you might be disappointed by the follow up.	2015-08-31

In fact, it seems to have taken several sci fi chestnuts and whipped them into a familiar tasting but still palatable dish. The lovable robots, the evil robots, the aliens driven by desperation to colonize Earth, the astronaut who brings back an interstellar virus, the broke-down-but-heart-of-gold combat vet, the evil mega-corporation with the shadowy infrastructure: all our favorites! Familiarity is not necessarily a bad thing, especially when good acting and a little tweaking of dialogue and plot make the familiar fun. Great escape series, for my money.	2015-08-31

Facing a artificial intelligence robot that tries to destroy the world and kill all humanity. New people joining the team to add extra power and more people to fight the enemies.  Turning the members of the team against each other was one of the ideas that the enemy used to fight The Avengers. Although the world almost got destroyed but the team made it to save the day again. The acting was great with the special effects. Everything worked together in a great way to make a wonderful film that made many people around the world like it. Also the acting of the people made the film work great. Picking Scarlett Johansson to do black widow worked great to the film. Her acting was good the moves and some of the scene she did were great. On the other hand picking Mark Ruffalo to do the Hulk wasnâ€™t the smartest thing for me. I donâ€™t think that doing Hulk is good for him because I see him as a calm person not a person with anger management problems. He always seems calm to me. The trailer locked great by showing some of the best scenes of the movie. This film collected around 1.4bil $ this year from all around the world. By having a lot of good reviews many people think that this film is one of the best films this year.	2015-08-31

All of the characters are given a good amount of focus even with the new characters that are introduced. I love the team chemistry the Avengers have with each other they play off each other in battle real well. The Hulkbuster vs Hulk fight was badass Tony stark manages to go toe to toe with the green rage monster and put up a damn good fight.<br /><br />I love the focus and development on Hawkeye they did seem to be setting him up to die by giving him a family and promising to make it home, but in the end I'm glad they did'nt do that he's one of my favorite marvel heroes. Everything in the farmhouse is great character building for the Avengers. They do set up future plots for the mcu but those never felt intrusive to me I think there was only like 4 scenes in the movie that did that and they were usually pretty quick. The relationship with Black widow and Hulk was a pretty nice one to see, and it makes sence their relationship started when Black widow went to get him and since then they've had alot of interaction to build some nice chemistry.<br /><br />Captain America and Iron man you can tell friction is building in this movie. Their ideals clash even harder than they did in the last movie and it eventually leads to a brief fight between them, it was a nice little preview for what we'll see in Civil War the tension was high but once Vision was created everything came into prospective again. The climax of the move was just epic, Hawkeye being the one to finally convince the other two to become Avengers with that awesome yet hillariouis speech was just great. Despite the earlier tension the team puts that aside to finish the job.<br /><br />All in All this movie was just as epic as the first Avengers and it's a damn shame some people can't seem to see that.	2015-08-31

Let me start by saying, throwing in Marg Helgenberger was a HUGE mistake. She doesn't fit the rest of the cast and has been the center of the frustration this third season has brought.<br />The story line has dwindled as well but that's overlooked by the under-climactic scenes. I mean we've been waiting to see that baby born for what seems like forever now and episode 10 just put out the dwindling fire. It started with the mildly boring acting and finished with upsetting one liners.... And Seriously, Jr WALKS out of the house in front of half a dozen armed aktaion employes, they seriously watch him leave?!?! I mean I've seen bad writing but this is just pitiful. And the whole &#34;is he kinship, is he not&#34; is such a sad excuse for some added drama. Newsflash... They're under a freaking DOME! Tell the writers to get with it already. Good on these actors for still working and putting forth their best effort to save a desperately failing tv show.<br />All in all it is still entertaining because I've watched since season 1. But I will not be watching a 4th season if there is one.<br />Aaaaaaaannd , I bet they're regretting killing off all the good characters in the first season.	2015-08-31

It's like bad CGI from 1990. I watched it only because my pre-teen son and I were having a great time picking it apart. For instance, look for the blue Chevy pickup as a background vehicle in 2 or three scenes AFTER it's been destroyed by the monster. Modern-day street signs in a movie set in the late 50s. Oh, and the scene in the cave when the two guys are splashed with chemicals and their faces melted off? Hilarious, especially when they take turns screaming. &#34;Aaargh!&#34; &#34;Aaaaargh!&#34; &#34;Aaaaargh!&#34;	2015-08-31

Good character development and basically, a good story.  On the downside, it was very dark and there seemed to be more complexity than was really necessary.  Now, I don't mind dark, in fact, for the most part I really like any story that addresses a dark subject in a manner that is serious and not &#34;Hollywood&#34; cartoonish.  That being said, I found myself wanting to go back to the earlier scenes to determine what I might have missed.  If it had not been for the (in my opinion) undue complexity, I'd have given it five stars.	2015-08-31

So there's that.	2-stars is the fairest rating.  Manu is a coati.  I thought it was a type of monkey, but it's a relative of the raccoon that lives in Central & South America.  He by his nature gets into trouble and gets exiled.  Sacha, also a coati, is his friend/sorta girlfriend and also princess of the tribe.  She goes looking for Manu and is captured by poachers.  The story goes on from there and has a moral of accepting others as they are.<br /><br />Pro's:  Eh, It wasn't horrible.<br /><br />Cons:  The cheap looking animation style.<br />  The really simplistic dialog of the script.	2015-08-31

I love the actress who plays the Producer...she is tough, sweet, gentle and she is a pleasure to watch.  There is no bitchiness about her, just real, calm, funny.  She commands respect, but doesn't have to be a jerk to get it.  Thanks for making a series filled with people that are easy to relate to.  It is wonderful to watch after a tough day at work.

In their position I would grow poppy plants as well. If people in the West are dumb enough to choose to use drugs I see nothing wrong in profiting from their stupidity. It happens even with many legal products that people buy even when they do them harm at the worst or of no benefit at best. Tobacco for one thing. A person can plant tobacco and it is legal and hey if people are dumb enough to smoke. Or heck there are a lot of just plain dumb stuff out their that become fads and we buy them like crazy and look back later and wonder what the Hell we were thinking. So yeah I see nothing wrong in profiting on people's just plain stupidity	2015-08-31

Pretty much every one of the cast members is painful to watch this season, but for different reasons: Shannon, because her marriage is disintegrating and she's in complete denial; Meghan because she's not the sharpest tool in the shed, and her awkward pauses during conversations where she's desperately searching for a word are distracting; Heather because her new house is obnoxious, Tamra because she's still on the show.. it's clear she's even getting on her husband's last  nerve, and they've only been married 2 years. I would have never thought that Vicky would be the most watchable or sane person on here, but it's been 10 seasons so I guess it was her turn. Probably not the best choice to film the actual moment she learned of her mother's death though.<br /><br />It might be time for the OC to go back behind the gates. Would like to see it replaced with a Real Housewives of Silicon Valley. Hope someone from Bravo is reading... Same level of wealth and perhaps a smarter cast.	2015-08-31

If you want something good for the whole family this is a great option.  It is so beautifully done that it keeps the younger member's of your family engaged but has such a wonderful story line that the older member's of the family stay engaged as well.  Not to mention that Korra herself teaches lessons of being selfless, compassionate, and ultimately getting up when a mistake knocks you down.  I enjoyed watching this with both my 9 year old who LOVED it and and my hubby (52) who kept saying one more episode, then one more episode, and we were all held in rapt attention!  Now if you have very young ones such as 0-4 then you may want to watch an episode or two to decide for yourself whether you personally think it is appropriate for how you are raising your children because the bending of the elements and using them to fight may be more &#34;cartoon violence&#34; than you want your children seeing.

I mean maybe the entire budget was spent on the first few scenes on board the ship because the rest are of the main girl running at Red Rock.  I fast forwarded through most of it hoping it would pick up but it didn't.  The story wasn't even original, it was a mix of Mad Max and Planet of the Apes.  Did anyone else wonder how miss thing could continue running, climbing and fighting for days on what 5 or 6 blueberries.  She is one touch cookie....	2015-08-31

Watch this war movie	Most war movies give you action for action sake. This movie takes you into the heart in the mind of a particular operation that took place toward the end of World War 2. The Herting Forest operation was one of the most dismal planned and poorly executed Allied operations in the Western Front. This movie shows this on a personal level. It shows to how personal heroism energies from some of the most unlikely candidates making this a very believable war movie. The themes of how well this movie is written present themselves as an attractive way of mapping out the progress of the movie as it precedes. From carrying friends in the beginning to being carried by friends at the end are the kind of book ends the movie elaborates on in order to follow the cobat by the personal till it takes on the major players and how they died in the midst of this terrible operation. It is a thoughtful and provoking movie that helps you to understand what troops offered in this operation. I recommended it highly for those who want to watch and learn about the real costs of war.	2015-08-31

Digital_Video_Download	4	1	1	N	N	UNTIE YOURSELF	The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.	2015-08-31

This is a well researched and informative documentary, and worth watching just for the interviews with Georgia O'Keefe. How they got her to agree to be interviewed, I don't know, but it says something about the producers that they were able to accomplish this.<br /><br />We've all seen Mr. Strand's photos, so I think the whole point in watching a movie about him is to learn more about him and his life.<br />I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought the (quite brief, actually) segment about his career in film making was slow, as my impression was quite the opposite, and since this is a documentary film and Mr. Strand spent many years as a movie cameraman it's completely logical that this would also be a part of the film, not just his still photography. I thought this segment was very interesting, especially to see his film making style, which reminded me of Sergei Eisenstein's, and which we probably won't see anywhere else, and to learn that he was taking on very serious subjects such as racial intolerance, the KKK, and McCarthyism. Also that his decision to move to Europe was largely because of these issues.<br /><br />Seeing Mr. Strand wielding his monstrously huge Graflex SLR (5x7?) was also a highlight.<br /><br />The musical soundtrack was nothing special, kind of typical of a low budget documentary, but I wasn't watching the movie to listen to the music. The &#34;Ken Burns&#34; style of showing the photos was the weakest and most distracting part of the film for me. I felt that the film makers should have displayed the photos in full view first, and then panned around if they felt the need to push that button on iMovie. If the rest of the film had not been so informative I would have knocked a star off for this, but there was so much else about it that was really good that I kept it at five.<br /><br />I was not surprised at the end to learn from the credits that this film was funded by the Canadian National Film Board. I have watched numerous documentaries funded by this agency, and they have all been of high quality. One can also go to their website and watch a lot of movies for free. Most of them were made by the CBC.	2015-08-31

I may change my review as the season progresses, but so far this is a lame excuse for a Walking Dead prequel. Where are the vibrant characters and story lines I have come to love from the WD writers?  These people are uninteresting and flat and dumb. By episode 2, I don't care about them at all. I was hoping for a more global view of the initial spread of the virus, but instead I am stuck following a dysfunctional family and an addict - both of which are totally stupid.  BOO.... yet.....I am compelled to watch the next episode even though I have found myself completely disappointed thus far. I am trying to find hope in what seems like a hopeless set of characters I hope will die so we can get on with some new people.<br /><br />WD writers - what were you thinking?????	2015-08-31

Ben Whishaw is without out a doubt the greatest Shakespearean actor of our day. Rory Kinnear's performance was top notch.

It's a shocking, eye-opening view of what the country does to young minds in order to create kill-crazed Marines for service to The Country.  And when they get killed, we call them heroes.

I have been wanting to watch a Ken Burns documentary for awhile and am so grateful they are available on Amazon Prime. Living in Oklahoma, I wanted so much to learn more about this pivotal time in our history. I've appreciated the in-depth look, not just at what it was like to live in that time, but all the factors that led up to the events. I had never heard most of the facts regarding how this disaster was man-made or what brought &#34;no man's land&#34; to that point. I really appreciate that this video gives first-hand accounts, focusing on real families and individuals and how they were personally affected by all that occurred. It gives a realistic, yet personal view of history while giving me the opportunity to truly consider what it must have been to live through something so devastating. Truly powerful. My one complaint is simply the length - but that &#34;complaint&#34; is meager, as it does not drag or seem needlessley lengthy. It takes awhile to get through, but there is a lot of information to cover.	2015-08-31

Hector Feliciano, who had nothing directly to do with recovering these particular paintings but whose book &#34;The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy To Steal The World's Greatest Works Of Art &#34; ignited the world's sensitivity to the issue, was a student of mine at Columbia.	2015-08-31

An accident occurred on stage were Charlie was hung. Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler)  joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.<br /><br />The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films.  We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming. I liked it. The problem I had with the twist is that there is a &#34;discovery&#34; of things that happened 20 years ago, secrets I didn't think would exist in a small town where everybody knows everyone's business.<br /><br />Guide: 1 whispered F-bomb.

So when is the last time a movie, as long anticipated as Fury Road, has been even half as satisfying as this one? Never...this is movies done right and blew me away with the care, imagination and visuals this movies exudes constantly. Paying attention Hollywood???? There is no yuppie new (therefore cheaper) kid director out to prove his chops, only the guy that made the first movies and was obvious personally invested in the movie's success. I'd say he has struck oil with this latest installment. An absolute must watch for any action junkie and anybody else out there that wants to see a non-stop, flame spurting, spike impaling, machine gun firing, grenade throwing, mechanical claw ripping, blood transfusing, body powdering, people crushing, bike jumping, gun blasting, fantabulous movie.	2015-08-31

As you know, the movie &#34;The Man Who Knew Too Much&#34;, this is a remake of the Hitchcock. This is one of the rare cases where the remake is created much better than the original. I think this film is a benchmark of a Thriller and tension. Legendary actor James Stewart  reliably played an exemplary family man who is forced to participate in a very difficult and dangerous business. This film was made over half a century ago, but until now staging Hitchcock captivates and causes a lot of experiences. Indeed, Hitchcock unsurpassed master of the psychological Thriller!	2015-08-31

The writing and storylines seem to have gotten better -- and, of course, there's always Seven of Nine to ogle during slack spots in the action. Although, I have to say her acting has improved somewhat and she is no longer just the eye candy she was when first brought on board the show (ratings reportedly jumped more than sixty percent with her addition to the cast.) Anyway, watching the show now on Amazon or Netflix is a welcome respite from a busy day.	2015-08-31

The first season was really good. Second season I felt they kinda messed up what made the show interesting, but it had its positives. Third season went way off the rails and basically turned into something that viewers never signed on for. Plus it seemed to start running in circles. Still, I enjoyed it while it lasted and I did like some of the character development (even though other characters were horribly written and made no sense from one action to the next).	2015-08-31

The story of his family and how they are affected by his life changes and his coming out to them at this point in his life and theirs is mixed with warmth, humor and sadness. It is a story of human failings and family dysfunction. Judith Light is almost a caricature of an aging Jewish mother, the long divorced wife of Tambor's character. The behavior of their three, mostly middle-aged adult children is beyond annoying, as they are the most self-centered, spoiled and hopelessly unaware group of adults imaginable. And yet they each have their moments of human compassion. This story is a testimony for social inclusiveness.	2015-08-31

The blended family storyline was actually a interesting though we know their little everyday problems will not matter compared to what lies ahead. The mother was a little annoying fretting so much over her drug addict son. And why on Earth would the step father go into a crack house to investigate a possible homicide instead of alerting the police? I have to admit I fell asleep the first time waiting for Zombie action. Still I found the story engaging though I am not sure I care yet whether the characters survive the apocalypse.	2015-08-31

The reason is that it's purpose was to crusade against the death penalty.  The film was made after much lobbying by Ed Montgomery, a newspaperman who opposed the death penalty and the film itself is warped at every point to make its central character, Barbara Graham, the character played by Susan Hayward, appealing to the audience.  Despite the ham-handed efforts to secure our sympathies for Graham, the film works well enough on its own terms as Graham is finally executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin.  The ending has power to shock even though the stage management by the director is clumsy and leaden.<br /><br />The Graham story is in fact a good deal more nuanced than you'd ever know from the movie, which makes it appear that Graham is condemned on the basis of purged testimony obtained through a plea bargain.  Ironically, the real Graham story was a good more of a noir story than the one depicted in I Want to Live! and would have been far more interesting than the one-dimensional screed which made it to the screen.	2015-08-31

I wanted to watch this movie to see some more of Jamie Dornan's acting. I think he's a strong actor but this was not a strong project. The part about the pigeons was enlightening in explaining the fascination with them, but the plot around the pigeons just wasn't present enough. This was basically a lackluster film for him. That explains why it went straight to DVD releases earlier this year (2015) ahead of 50 Shades... I do look forward to his other movies coming up...	2015-08-31

US	14063405	R1E4W9ROP10WT3	B013QMAZ80	438237578	Digging for Fire	Digital_Video_Download	5	19	22	N	N	Charming and Clever	Joe Swanberg is changing the face of American independent cinema. In a matter of ten years, heâ€™s managed to direct eighteen feature films (including his latest â€œDigging For Fireâ€). Most of these have been made completely outside of the studio-system, being financed through credit cards and actors donating their time. Theyâ€™re purely improvisational, with Swanbergâ€™s only tool being an outline that heâ€™s authored. The actors, in turn, must completely inhabit their characters to the point of knowing what they might say or even do. â€œDigging For Fireâ€, which is undoubtedly his most star-studded film to date, takes this to a whole new level. Veterans such as Sam Elliott and Judith Light are sharing the screen with younger actors like Jake Johnson and Rosemarie DeWitt.<br /><br />The latter couple playing a husband and wife who, after finding a rusted gun and apparent human bone in the backyard of a house theyâ€™re staying in, are lead on separate adventures over the course of one weekend. The husband - obviously more curious about what else he might find - invites a group of his long-time friends to drink a few beers and dig up the truth. Meanwhile, his wife takes their son to visit her parents and get away from some of the marital stresses sheâ€™s facing.<br /><br />Itâ€™s this wonderfully odd comedy/mystery thatâ€™s entirely propelled by the connection between the actors and the director. Thereâ€™s an evident trust between the two, and the movie is infinitely better for that. Not to mention the fact that itâ€™s just a lot of fun to watch. The varied cast works together beautifully (some of the others include Orlando Bloom, Anna Kendrick, and Sam Rockwell) and the story unfolds in a charming and clever fashion. Definitely give Swanbergâ€™s latest film a look. He has a long and storied career ahead of him.	2015-08-31

The title is a little misleading in that the first half deals with Bismark's development and quick dispatch of Hood and the second half focuses on the Allied effort to track and destroy Bismark.  It is interesting in that it shows how new technologies make even very powerful ships incredibly vulnerable.  It also shows how a lone ship, no matter how formidable, is powerless against a vast array of foes who hunt it as hyenas hunt elephant calves.  One is reminded of the Yamato's fate in the Pacific.	2015-08-31

There is a good, solid Christian message in there-even though my 34-year marriage is great, this movie made me pause and think about it, and how I could make it even better.  There were some intense, nail-biting action scenes which made the movie even more enjoyable.  On top of all that, it has Kirk Cameron in it-I just love him and think he is a terrific actor.  It really impresses me that he sticks to his faith and stars in Christian movies instead of going the Hollywood route and taking anything he can for exposure to the public.  If you are addicted to the Hollywood blockbusters with outlandish plots, you may not enjoy this.  But if you are looking for a solid, faith-based, down-to-earth movie, please watch this-I highly recommend it!!	2015-08-31

When a classmate is murdered, no one appears the least bit traumatized. I get that it's a teen show, but how about we actually make the teens SOUND like teens? And maybe do a more thorough job vetting through the auditions. I gave it two stars because there are suspenseful parts, you just have to put up with teens being ridiculously melodramatic while simultaneously utilizing a vocabulary that most teenagers (especially this sort) wouldn't be able to comprehend.	2015-08-31

Like most of Johnny Depp's work it has multiple levels; here you have a basic retelling of the origin story of The Lone Ranger plus the plight of the American Indians at the hands of the Robber Barons. All while a grief crazed Tonto and his dead raven have you rolling on the floor. Action scenes are amazing , funny, and brutal all at the same time.<br /><br />Then it gets strange! Depp Strange ! Tonto is a Windego Hunter and Silver the Spirit Horse is even crazier than the dead raven.<br />Be prepared to Love it, Hate it, or possibly both at the same time. Another Cult Classic for the Deppster and even more disturbing than &#34;The Ninth Gate.&#34;	2015-08-31

I'm a big fan of SciFi and enjoyed this season with some small exceptions.  No spoilers here folks...  First, I find it difficult to believe that a trained astronaut and scientist would consistently be so hysterical and lacking in methodical reasoning and approach to the unknown.<br /><br />Pros: Interesting writing that includes several interesting back stories that I'm sure will continue to grow and influence the main storyline.<br /><br />Cons: Halle Berry's character is inconsistent and seems fraught with emotionally unreasoning reactions to situations with &#34;Ah-Ha&#34; moments of epiphany that I would not find consistent with a well trained and tested astronaut and scientist. I have always found this type of character to be particularly annoying and look forward to their demise over time.	2015-08-31

Jackson's weakest role yet but maybe he was supposed to be ridiculous and I just didn't get it.  Fight/Gore sequences were too long and I LIKE those kinds of scenes.  Could have used some editing but once Coling Firth was dead, I was no longer invested in wasting time on this film.  I finished but wouldn't watch again.	2015-08-31

Jim Parsons doesn't do a ton of voice acting, which is probably a good thing because so much of his comedic effect comes from his expressions, gestures, etc., none of which were present in his alien character which rendered it a bit flat.

Great movies were made during the time of this productionâ€”without gratuitous sex (or its overtures) and without undue violence. Bogart and Tierney were superb in their roles, and quite touching. I was sad to learn that it was during this production that Miss Tierney (how wonderfully beautiful she was) â€”it was during this time that she began manifesting deep depression which plagued her most of her life. I thought, how utterly sad; but how wonderful (as I read) that Mr. Bogart was such an understanding and benevolent gentleman, who, when needed, often fed Miss Tierney her lines, as she had great difficulty in some scenes. The acting was somewhat understated, which, to me, made the roles all the more to be cherished an lauded in this day of violence, untoward behavior, and everything seemingly disturbed and evil.. I will watch this movie again, and that is how I know that I appreciate a film. Look at the beautiful Tierney and . . . well, I don't know what else to say, except just to see her made the film worthwhile for me. I highly recommend it for those who long for normalcy in film roles and for acting that says what it should say without &#34;grabbing&#34; one by the throat!	2015-08-31

The storyline is weak and the main character (Zen) hard to identify with because of the emotional limitations she has. The acting is just OK, maybe better than many similar movies. The reason for watching this movie though IS the fighting, it's great! I loved watching the zany ways that Zen defends herself and sends the bad guys running. If you make it to the end stay for the out-takes, they reveal just how much blood and sweat went into making those great fight scenes for our entertainment.	2015-08-31

Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was the first action movie in a long time to actually bore me.  Lots of other reviewers have said it best the film is too long, has too many explosions with no real point to them, way too much slapstick comedy and no overall story whatsoever.  I still don't get why Shia Labeouf's character is important to the Autobots he is not Albert Einstein or anything.  Megan Fox is basic eye candy but she never gets semi-naked or does anything remotely interesting in the movie.<br /><br />I grew up with the cartoon show and I thought the first Transformers movie was decent.  It had a plausible story and worked for the most part.  This 2nd live action film is a train wreck that never flipping over the whole movie.<br /><br />To me the best Transformers movie to come out is still the cartoon movie which came out in 1986.  Maybe if the live action movies would make a \\"Unicron\\" aka Death Star transformer it might actual be a good story to film in live action.  Any story is better than what this movie came up with.<br /><br />While watching Transformers Revenge of the Fallen I was thinking of another sequel that came out in the same time period that was downright awful \\"Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest\\".  Both films are follow-ups to decent box office hits, but both sequels are hard to watch and make it through to the end.  I felt the same way watching the pirates sword fight play, as I did watching the transformers fighting it just gets monotonous and boring.  Kind of like the \\"A team\\" where 10,000 rounds get fired and no one gets injured, hurt, or killed.  You don't buy it as a viewer and just start yawning.<br /><br />The devastator robot was really dumb looking as well.  How come they just did not use the actual 6 construction vehicles from the old TV show paint them lime green and use the CGI to make Devastator look cool like the cartoon version.  With Michael Bay's unlimited budget for this film that would have looked so much betterthan what they came up with.<br /><br />I would rate this film 1 and a half to 2 stars.  It is not worth your time and the human characters will annoy you in no time flat.  Go watch the wonderful cartoon version from 1986 instead.  Half the time and a much better overall movie.	2015-08-31

I will watch more of it at a later time, when I feel I can handle the emotions. The only thing I would say is that abuse is not always this visible in public. Only in a place where social conventions uphold this type of treatment does it seem like a man would be able to demonstrate his abuse in public (though as one reviewer noted, some do not approve of his behavior). Where conventions have changed, abuse goes on in secret. My heart goes out to Ninah, and to every woman her character represents. It seems like a well made film. I hope other viewers will pardon my writing a review after having only watched a short amount.	2015-08-31

The tie-in with current events is the most worthwhile part of the plot lines, with the personal relationship stuff being the weakest part.  Pity that someone with the gravitas of Aaron Sorkin feels it necessary to add the sophomoric romantic subplots to what is otherwise adult entertainment.  Similarly, it's disappointing that he turns the female roles into a mostly scatterbrain bunch (except for the few appearances of Jane Fonda who is given a heavyweight role), while the men are fairly emotionally stable.  But still, overall, well done.	2015-08-31

She's upbeat and interesting the whole of the movie as a protagonist.  Tim Daly is great,and it wouldn't be the same movie without him, but it's between Penelope and Louis Jourdan, the antagonist, for the movie's character.  Most movies are made, for me, within the first few seconds with this movie it's when Penelope goes to Scotland, this is where the upbeat character of the movie is cemented.<br /><br />The plot line is thin, although not implausible; it's the scenery and upbeat story line, with little funny one offs strewn throughout the movie, that makes the movie fun to watch.  This to me is another, 'Better Off Dead' or 'Grosse Point Blank'	2015-08-31

It is not a bad series although, like the original &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; it could have used some more science in it's science fiction.  The first season is the best of the two seasons it played, in my opinion.  It does have some good actors and &#34;guest artists&#34; from the British acting community.  It was the most expensive show on the air at that time and it shows in the effects and the sense that you were on the Moon. The premise is a bit shaky but most of Gerry Anderson's shows had shaky premises.  However, there were many fine points in the show with &#34;The Black Sun&#34; probably the best of the lot after the initial episode when the Moon is blasted out of orbit.	2015-08-31

He is the typical lonely detective which is central to the plot of the series.  The misunderstood, bad boy(Dirty Harry comes to mind here) cop, which is to say your fundamental movie cop character.  Bosch is detached but he is a romanticist and thus yields a character everyone can relate to.  The plot itself is creepy enough, child serial killer on the loose with Hannibal Lechter escape sequence.  Lance Reddick and Annie Wersching  turn in solid performances.  Bosch is solid cop entertainment and if you're a prime member I can't think of better ways to spend your evening vs searching the never ending list of free prime movies.  All in all this is a class Prime Production product.  Hope to see a second season	2015-08-31

If you've already acquired that skill---ie, been there, done that, and aware that we all have cosmically &#34;deep feelings&#34;---then it's more of a not-unpleasant trip down memory lane, back to the time(s) of your own awakening(s).  Excellent acting, and pretty engaging...but as other reviewers have noted, shoe-gazing/navel-gazing are great---got to live that &#34;examined life&#34; and all that jazz---but there's more to life than having tea/cookies with one's demons. So, kudos for being thoughtful and well-acted, but a little too familiar and annoying once it starts to sound like whining and look like moping. Gotta get up and keep  movin' down the trail, can't just sit here and feel sorry for ourselves all day!	2015-08-31

The entire series was extremely moving and powerful.  The depiction of life for average people in London during that period, the unbelievable pain and suffering caused by infectious illnesses and trauma, and the level of compassion (and angst) portrayed by the nurses and doctors left an indelible impression.  Several scenes of surgery were quite graphic, which could make some people very squeamish, but they added to the power of the program.	2015-08-31

I got exactly what I expected and left the film satisfied. Yes, this is another found film type horror flick. The entirety of the film, minus 5-10 minutes takes place in a skype video chat screen. The topic of cyber bullying is in the spotlight in society and media currently and this film puts a spotlight on it in a new way.<br /><br />The acting was above average for a film of this budget and I found myself actually scared a few times. I have been searching for a horror film that actually caused for pause when turning out the lights at night and this film came close. It won't win any awards, but I got exactly what I hoped for - A fun unique horror experience to enjoy with some friends.	2015-08-31

I personally loved this movie, and can't wait to watch the third!! But here is a dislaimer, for those that want to watch the movie in the hopes that it's like the original book, it's not. That doesn't mean it's bad, but like the walking dead and it's paralell universe (the one in the original comics and the one onscreen) this movie is different. This movie brings in some character's and events that further tie the Hobbit to the first trilogy, and appeals to those viewers that watched the fisrt trilogy but didn't read the books. Lover's of the Lord of the Rings trilogies will see some familiar faces and places while also meeting some very intresting new ones. I thought this movie was full of heart, story, adventure and it had more action than the first. The villans are fun, the movie is well paced and as always the music, well it's awseome.	2015-08-31

The characters are hilarious, and strangely Guest managed to include many of his favorite actors, including Michael McKean, Fred Willard, and, of course, Christopher Guest himself.<br /><br />Chris O'Dowd (from The IT Crowd) plays an Irishman from an English family who starts searching for his family roots after his late aunt leaves him a box of junk that turns out to be full of clues about his family's history. Eventually his quest leads him to California where he discovers a bunch of distant and strange relatives. The series ends unexpectedly with the main character torn between returning home and staying in California. It definitely feels like this show was meant to get a second season, but alas that didn't happen.<br /><br />One thing I love about the series is that the female characters are often funnier than the men. The main character's sister is deeply attached to a monkey puppet with a filthy mouth, and the main character's stepmother... let me just say there's a scene involving her where she isn't seen and you can't even hear her, but she made me laugh so long and hard.<br /><br />The whole thing is shot faux documentary style, which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Christopher Guest's work. In many ways, it reminds me of the original UK version of The Office, but without a drop of meanness. Chris O'Dowd's character has an open heart, and he's more than willing to embrace anything and everything he discovers about his family, no matter how insane it may be.<br /><br />I loved this show. The only problem I had with it (except for one unnecessary R-rated scene) is that it ended way too soon. It would be great if someone picked it up for a second season. Amazon, are you listening?eat if someone picked it up for a second season. Amazon, are you listening?	2015-08-31

I love this show.<br />The stories are told in the context of psychiatric sessions, and have powerful acting, since there's so many dramatic monologues and interaction involved.  Each patient goes from initial introduction to some sort of resolution of the issues addressed in his/her story, sometimes good and sometimes tragic.  It's possible to learn a lot about psychiatry, and it's engrossing trying to figure out the reasons for the behaviors brought to treatment.<br />I'm also hooked on how the good doctor will ever find happiness, himself.  Like some of his patients, I too am in love with him!!!	2015-08-31

If you don't mind cheap sound and special effects, definitely give this movie a try.  The acting is decent, and though its rather predictable (what movie isn't, really?), its good to see a horror movie that relies on context and environment cues to give the audience the creeps, rather than slash and gore cheap thrills.

Hank III looks and sounds like his granddad, they could of gone a bit more into it, but Id watch an etch a sketch about Hank if that's all there was.  So I liked it, but why make up the hokey stuff that Hank gave him the car, Hank JR drove that car in high school, he did not give that away.  Plus all the music is like a city version of country music, all the Hank sounds sound like they are sung by Tony Bennet.	2015-08-31

Classic movie, great cast which took me back many, many years.  From an era where most movie plots involved the glamour of the big city, this story was realistically based in a small town in the UP, and the movie sets were appropriate.  FYI, the movie is based on a book authored by Robert Travers, a judge better known for his writings about fly fishing.  Hence, the Stewart character's obsession with fishing.<br /><br />Loved seeing Jimmy Steward, Lee Remick, George C. Scott, and Eve Arden in action again.	2015-08-31

Extremely surprised at how much I loved it!  He did too!  Acting was superb!  Storyline held my attention the whole time.  It was slightly hard to follow in the beginning, but became easier and all made sense in the end.  Americans need to watch this film.  So interesting to see what life was like not so long ago in socialist countries.  People left such countries at great personal risk and came to the USA just to escape such oppressive regimes.  I liked the realistic portrayal of this society as the setting for the story of this serial killer.  Well worth the rental fee!!!	2015-08-31

Some of them are unintentionally funny and this one was downright hilarious only because it was SOOO bad that we spent the whole time mimicking the characters who ALL seemed to be heavily medicated or at least had IQs below 50. But curiously, there were several scenes and characters that had NO relevance to the story, other scenes that only served to illustrate some cliche profiling sterotypes, and gratuitous flashes of female body parts (the Sharon Stone effect) which were apparently only due to unfortunate camera angles. As for special effects or CGI content ...it was probably the worst I have ever seen. The tsunami was seemingly a Magic Tsunami that didn't actually destroy anything. Instead things just faded and disappeared while the unmoving wave hovered in the background spitting out what looked like puffs of dust. A second grader's cardboard shoebox diorama would have worked better. If I were rating this on the amount of thigh-slapping guffaw laughter it generated, then it would be five stars. But since money would have to be spent to see it, something I would like to get back along with that hour and a half of my life, then I have to go with a one star rating only because I cannot choose negative numbers of stars.	2015-08-31

Being able to review movies without knowing what you're talking about is just dumb.

Thats what trailers are for. You shouldn't have watched this film if the trailer didn't appeal to you.<br /><br />To the 1 star reviews.<br /><br />How dare you come here and tell people whats good and what isn't.<br /><br />Thats like telling people what genre music they should listen to.<br /><br />This isn't an appliance review where if it works it gets 4- 5 stars and if it doesn't it should get 1-2.<br /><br />This is an Action movie. Not a drama. Meaning there doesn't have to be an in depth story. Its also the first movie in a modern day trilogy and its not a mad max reboot. Its a continuation.

First, I have always been a big U.N.C.L.E. fan all my life from the very first episode which was aired on September 21, 1964.  I was only 9 years old at the time but &#34;the man from U.N.C.L.E&#34; left a lifelong impression on me.  It's one of the driving reasons I went into Law Enforcement.  I collected anything and everything that was U.N.C.L.E related and still have that collection today!<br /><br />So, with all this in mind, here is my take on the movie: If one is expecting to see the show with hopes of re-experiencing our two favorite agents entering the secret entrance to the New York HQ via Del Floria's Tailor Shop you are going to be disappointed!  Because this is NOT the premise of the movie.<br /><br />However, for all the fans that can get into the idea of seeing a prequel on how, Illya Kuryakin, Napoleon Solo and Alexander Waverly first meet (and getting to know a lot more about all their backgrounds); then you are in for a treat!  The movie does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of life in the early 1960â€™s and set stage for a great spy thriller of two agents (one CIA and the other KGB) being forced to work together to prevent an international criminal organization from using a Nuclear bomb to instigate a world crisis. While THURSH is never mentioned by name; we all know who is behind this!<br /><br />The movie is fast paced, full of car chases, plot twists, intrigue, plot twists and even double twists to keep the most avid spy and mystery lover guessing all the way through the end of movie!  You can take nothing for granted and many things and people are not what they seem!  For hardcore U.N.C.L.E. fans your will get to see our beloved â€œU.N.C.L.E Carbine Specialâ€ faithfully reproduced make an appearance in several of the big battle scenes near the end of the movie!<br /><br />Bottom line this is a classic spy/action thriller!  With lots of classic U.N.C.L.E humor thrown in to break the mood when thing get a little too intense!  No spoilers here so you will have to see the nail biting end for yourselves; but it is worth the manicure to get there!!	2015-08-31

Then there is a hive mind takeover causing a split within the factions in town.  Just another set of under the dome episodes - where everyone is goofy, and the government is trying to help out.  This season stretches out the franchise - covering weeks three and four after the mysterious dome suddenly came down over the town of Chesters Mill.  If you are invested in the series, you'll watch it.  But that's about the only reason to.	2015-08-31

What was Dudley Pictures International Corporation of Cuba, S.A.?  The credited production company of this exhausted effort, which was released by Allied Artists to no acclaim on 1957.  It's tempting to think how mob money sluicing through Havana could have been laundered through the ostensible production costs of these and other B-pics made in Cuba just before the Revolution.  At any rate, Dudley ceased to exist after this single effort.  Platinum blonde Burr's salacious stares at the smoldering young Cassavetes in the first half are also intriguing to watch.  There's more heat between these two than with the third side of the triangle, the blonde femme fatale, Miss Sara Shane.  Burr got his first wheelchair role in this, a decade before &#34;Ironside.&#34;  The movie only comes alive when Celia Cruz shows up and everybody goes into their dance.	2015-08-31

Mind you, I am a huge fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey, 2010: The Year We Made Contact, and Contact. Interstellar had an overall good storyline and special effects, but Nolan tried to make this movie like Inception and you just can't do that in this type of movie. It becomes convoluted, cheesy and un-credible. Too much time was spent on building the character's relationships, feelings, etc. instead of exploring the mystery of space time. Also, McConaughey was so much better as a supporting actor in Contact, than as a lead in this. He looks so gaunt in this and it seemed like there was just too much on his plate. It's like ever since Dallas Player's Club, the movie industry is trying to suck the acting out of him while he's still in his prime. And the ending, which is supposed to be the 'gotcha' moment, was so quickly wrapped up that I just brushed it off. Interstellar proved more to be like Transformers and Signs rolled into one.	2015-08-31

I would like to see more films like this one or even a Hollywood production depicting how dogs are used in war. I would have liked to have had more detail about the dogs and the interaction with others as well as the working aspect of each in its own expertise. That said I found this film great as far as it went. It told the story of both the dog and handler, how they were selected and trained. Not every dog, not everyone who wants to be a handler is selected. It takes a special kind of person and a special type of dog to do what this film is about. The film described the daily grind and rewards as well as a few special moments in the lives of the team's. Action wasn't missing, and the bond between dog and handler was clearly depicted. Well worth watching and may watch it again, soon.	2015-08-31

The perfectly perfect Kate Winslet portrays a widow who must make her living in a metier most often practiced by men, that of landscape design.<br />So naturally, and with little struggle, she's commissioned to add a garden to the palace at Versailles. The plot of this film may be a little thin and probably historians are tearing out their hair over the lack of historical accuracy but, nevertheless, A Little Chaos has great charm and is beautifully filmed. The star performances are evenly low key and several familiar faces seem to have fun in their supporting roles. Alan Rickman, who also directs, may be the calmest Louis XIV ever seen on screen. There ought to be more overt passion, but alas. In any case, I'd recommend A Little Chaos to all. Four stars, for sure, and five stars for the whole look of it, costumes, sets, cinematography.	2015-08-31

This started out being hard to figure out as to whether it was really going to be a show that valued integrity and truth, and actually the first couple of episodes we were still believers.  Seeing unannounced Jane Fonda quietly take the scene made us suspicious.  And then before long the bs got deeper and deeper and we quit about a quarter of the way through episode 4 of season 1.  If you drink the koolaid of the cult then this is for you.  It puts a spin on the spin to make it seem like the lies are true. Too bad.... because the acting, dialogue, story line is captivating and well done. Government politically correct propaganda at its best worst!	2015-08-31

The fact that so many Americans are &#34;in on the joke,&#34; and laugh about the absurdity of their own civilization concerns me. This isn't the first movie to raise awareness on a rather serious issue, while at the same time being flippant about its own message. Idiocracy comes to mind. And although God Bless is funny, at times, I feel guilty for finding it so. Here is a movie that highlights and ridicules the most shallow aspects of entertainment in the country, and rather than leave it at that, it devolves into some awful parody of itself by investing in massive amounts of violence. Maybe the director is trying to pander to his audience, who even though they believe themselves to be above the vile figures portrayed, are nothing more than consumers of the very filth railed against in the film. This is hypocrisy at its finest, in other words, and everyone is in on it. Me too, and I hate myself because of that. Having seen the previews before, I started watching the film with some knowledge of the plot. I wanted to sit and watch the mutilation and destruction of things that I see as repugnant. Unfortunately, I became repugnant for indulging in that desire. I haven't felt this dirty watching a flick since Borat.<br /><br />Structurally, God Bless is very well-made. Even if the ending is predictable, you get that feeling as with all good road-trip movies -- you're just along for the ride, no matter the destination. The acting is superb. The only other program I've seen Joel Murray in is Mad Men. He was a decent choice for the disillusioned Frank. And the fantastic Tara Lynne Barr, his sidekick, reminds me of a young Christina Ricci.<br /><br />Be wary of a film that preaches one thing and practices another. Maybe I took its theme a little too seriously. I doubt it. There is something perverse here.	2015-08-31

Curved edges show no signs of moiree or aliasing, color is good if somewhat dark (the current movie standard). Consult the I-Ching and it will tell you to watch this show.

From the first moments of episode one in Prime, you develop an affinity for the characters, both autobot and decepticon.  In Robots in Disguise, the characters may be 3D rendered, but they lack any depth.  If you are a Transformers fan, give this a try simply because it's a continuation of the &#34;Prime/Beast Hunters/Predacons Rising&#34; storyline.  Otherwise, I'd say give this a pass.	2015-08-31

Instead of focusing on the traditional parts of Casanovas life, the story begins after his infamy and subsequent imprisonment.  I was particularly impressed by the caliber of the secondary characters acting, and the set's attention to detail.  She's design is beautiful and historically accurate. The acting of the lead character was a little rough in the beginning, but as the show moved on, both the actor and the show hit its stride.  If particular note are the historical details of the time.  I enjoyed the scene where an older, widowed woman sinks her time and fortune into the peudosciend and search for meaning in life and the hereafter.  Overall, it was a promising and engaging beginning to what looks like an entertaining show.  I hope the series is given the green light by Amazon.  I, for one, will be watching the rest.	2015-08-31

This really isn't a &#34;movie&#34;, so-to-speak, just my opinion, anyway. It's good, to be clear, but it's more like, listening to an author, tell of his experience while in a coma, or the writings in his book, per-say. It is quite compelling! I just expected, I guess, for it to have been illustrated into a movie. Had I known that, before purchasing it, I would have known what to expect? Then, I probably would have rated this with 5 stars.	2015-08-31

As a hiker that might someday do the PCT, I was interested in that part of it, and thought this was a movie about that.<br /><br />In reality it was more about her personal relationship struggles (mostly with her mother).<br /><br />A major criticism my PCT-experienced friends have is that they failed to capitalize on some of the more beautiful parts of the PCT. Mostly they chose boring, less scenic locations than they could have. If she hiked all the way from Mexico to the Bridge of the Gods (Washington / Oregon border), why not choose some of the best parts to film at? (Crew didn't want to hike in to these more remote places? Had to stick close to roads?)	2015-08-31

I had heard through friends that this show was great but never really gave it much thought.

Was beyond excited when I realized that I will be able to watch all 7 seasons on Amazon. Just finished the first season last night and can't wait to jump right into the next one. I have never been one to really watch or get too involved with any television shows, but, this show has definitely peaked my interest and keeps me wanting to watch more and more.

And these kids couldn't even get lost properly.  Boring.  Confusing. Stifled.<br /><br />The name of the book is The Ritual.  And it was 4 friends, not 3.

Great characters and outstanding plotting with fantastic period sets is very marred by the incessant use of profanity. I do not understand why HBO equates literary quality with soft core porn. Now Netflix and Amazon made movies are following suit. Speaking of suit, 'Suits' is an exceptional dramedy which has a modicum pf light profanity used to enhance the plot line. HBO, Netflix, and Amazon should take a look at this type of quality, adult based fare.	2015-08-31

Not only the part how this movie describes human condition but also the historical part of the movie. I highly recommend this stylistically well made movie because it is just so amazing when I see the horse jumping around the field and bring hopes to the people in the Great War.<br />The background of the movie happened during the World War I. The horse, named Joey, did not give up on his life during the Great War. Joey brought hopes to the devastated soldiers on both Allies and Germans. During World War I, millions of people died because the war was fought in a different way, as known as trench war. Generals make soldiers dig trenches to make defiance and it makes the offence become very hard, and even more, the troops are already using machine guns from the beginning of the war and millions of people will die under the machine guns. When Joey ran in to the field, there are wires and bodies everywhere. Suddenly, Joey was trapped in the wires and both Germans and British soldiers canâ€™t believe what they are seeing â€“ a living animal at the middle of the war zone. The appeared of Joey makes both German and British send a soldiers to help rescue him and that makes troops on both sides disengage for a while. After Joey was rescued, he was send back to the doctor for surgery and at the same place is where he met his original owner, Albert. After the war, Joey and Albert went back to home together and the movie end with a happy ending.<br />After watching the whole movie, I can feel the powerful vitality spreading from Joey, miracles happened on this creature. He makes me believe that I shouldnâ€™t give up on anything. Really, everyone should go watch this movie. It definitely worth it.	2015-08-31

Not for education.<br />I forgot how many familiar faces were in this flick. It was nice to re-watch for that purpose. My main problem was while the theme is mostly anti-war, it consistently glorifies it in a really simplistic and cliche way that makes you feel like a lot of directorial inspiration was spawned from the success of Braveheart. Or from WWII propaganda flicks.<br /><br />The ever-evil Lucious Malfoy killing babies and whatever was 100% evil, though - and none of that sulky &#34;I'm afraid of Voldemort&#34; nonsense. Nice and simplistic counter to Gibson's faux-complicated, overly stereotypical, quiet, reluctant war hero with a haunted past.<br /><br />However, at no point in the actual Revolutionary War is there an evil Lucious Malfoy killing babies, nor did Mel Gibson's character actually exist in real life. Which is fine, I can accept a good historical fiction. However as Spike Lee has said, &#34;It was a complete whitewashing [no pun intended, I'm sure] of history&#34; just like a propaganda flick. And not just in regards to race relations. Impact of regional, economy, villianizing of the British. I'm sure if this was rebooted, everything would be darker and more complicated. Alas, no more Heath Ledger to help make things dark and complicated. Also the failings of the Continental Army and militia is overly simplified to the point where it's just ugly.<br /><br />But that's cool. No harm no foul. Just keep in mind that while set in a semi-historical time period, none of this actually ever happened. And TchÃ©ky Karyo was boss.	2015-08-31

The effect is true to the essence of Marquis de Sade: his unstoppable compulsion and his affect on the social mores of those around him, in the culture at-large at the time, and to this day in the &#34;conflict&#34; between pure desire and &#34;proper&#34; behavior. The film is not pornographic, or pornographic for its own sake, using just enough to affirm the power of Sade's appeal and compulsion. Everything else aside, the gem of the film is the depiction of Sade's compulsive behavior: relentless, purposeful, never reflective, unstoppable under impossible circumstances. The film takes place in a mental hospital, where Sade has been confined by officialdom in the hope his volatile influence on French culture will be eliminated (and a progressive pastor/superintendent hopes he may be reformed). But he must write and publish his pornography. Sade will find a way despite every possible effort by the officials to remove any ability. Again and again, just when you think he can't possibly find a way, he does, an in ways that richly illustrate Sade's utter, devouring compulsion. The effect is powerful. For me, the lasting impression is the incredible power of the human spirit against all odds, up to and including destruction.	2015-08-31

To avoid the &#34;liability&#34;, they put &#34;Dramatizations inspired by History&#34; and &#34;altered for Dramatic Purposes&#34; at the beginning of the program.  Well, how can documentaries be &#34;inspired by History&#34;? It is very irresponsible.  The misconception is that one of the person giving the comment said that mainframe are these super computers operated by computer experts and Bill Gates know how to do it.  Well, actually, when in 1982, an Apple II can be already more complicated than the mainframes.  So knowing how to deal with the mainframe is not something &#34;genius&#34;.  The second inaccuracy is about Microsoft bundling Word and Excel with every copy of Windows.  As far as I know, that was not true.  You buy Windows, and all the time, you also have to buy Word, Excel, or Office separately.  The TV program said there was no choice for people to buy Windows without having Word or Excel -- that Word and Excel were already bundled and people have to get it together with Windows or a new PC.	2015-08-31

I was reading City of Bones at the time and I told him I thought Brasher was too young for Harry. SPOILER ALERT. Connelly said, &#34;Don't worry. It won't last.&#34; I'm a die-hard fan and was wondering for years who could play Bosch. Russell Crowe? Anyway, I was thrilled and also apprehensive to see that Harry made it to the screen AND it was under Connelly auspices. The review part: Welliver seems a little talkative and maybe a little too happy, but if he were as taciturn as Harry, it wouldn't make for very compelling TV. Jerry Edgar seems a little young but I'm glad they made him confident and able to hold his own with Harry. I could go on and on... Suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my first binge session. Knowing the books adds to the pleasure -- you feel a little like you've been through stuff with Harry before. Purely as police procedural and character study, still excellent. The L.A. location photography is beautiful!	2015-08-31

I liked Emma better than Bella. There were too many supporting characters that I did not like, and some episodes were poorly written because the situations did not make sense. For example, in one episode Cleo's father says good-bye to Cleo because Cleo is going to a party with her friends. It was obvious that he approved of the party Cleo was going to. Cleo's sister claims to be sick, but then sneaks out of the house. Cleo's father just sits on the couch talking with his new wife, and doesn't check to see if his daughter is feeling okay. What kind of father just sits on a couch and doesn't make sure his daughter is feeling okay? He also knows that his youngest daughter tends to be the trouble maker, and he never seems to suspect that she's trying to sneak out of the house. This father acts so naive and irresponsible. Only after Zane wants to take Cleo's sister home does her father show up. He then blames what happened on Cleo. While I'm watching this, I'm thinking, &#34;Hello, dad get off your butt, and watch your teenage kids.&#34; I know this show's main focus is supposed to be on Cleo, Bella, and Rikki; but the other characters need to be developed enough that they actually interact with the main characters instead of take up space, leave the viewer confused, or annoyed with what's being said and done. Seasons 1 and 2 were not perfect, but they were more enjoyable to watch.	2015-08-31

I've only watched half of the first season but it is also curious how Jeff Daniels' character keeps touting the fact that he is a republican, but it's unclear why.  He seems to have it in for republicans but not democrats...I think he could be a little more even handed :)  But it is interesting the way the use actual news events in the stories.	2015-08-31

It tells the story of Winston Churchill as  quite a &#34;has been&#34; politician, but who seeks out information on Germany's build up of power and rouses the nation to the danger of Hitler and his army.  Albert Finney did a good job on his portrayal of Churchill and Vanessa Redgrave added much strength and passion as his wife as she struggled to live a normal life with him.	2015-08-31

I'm already invested so I'll stay tuned in, but there is a major drop-off from the tension/suspense that existed in the first season. The relationships during season one seemed more established and less thrown together or forced than this time around. Visually the show is as sharp and well shot as season 1 and the way they seamlessly depict amazing future technology without it distracting from the story is impressive.	2015-08-31

This movies is good for family watching together.It is really fun movies and it told so many clues about the next movies,such as huge three-headed dog, Gringotts Wizarding Bank and Professor Quirrell. This all about a person Voldemort.At last,Voldemort left Quirrell to die and is likely to return by some other means.The Stone has now been destroyed.The school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys' for the summer holiday but does not tell them that under-age wizards are forbidden to use magic outside of Hogwarts.Ron and Hermione will be make friend with harry.They will go adventure  together.   Evil will never overcome the victory.

I've seen a number of films with Aaron Eckhart in a starring or supporting role. Most to the movies have benn pretty good but even in the poor ones like &#34;I, Frankenstein&#34;, Eckhart has been good.<br /><br />He is sometimes called by commenters - a &#34;poor man's Liam Neesom'. But that's not fair. Before 'Taken' Neesom was in approximately the same career place that Eckhart is now. One lucky hit and Neesom is a big star. That could happen to Eckhart too.<br /><br />But alas this film while good isn't the kind that is likely to transform Eckhart's career.  We had never seen Neesom play an action hero and that role fit him remarkably well. But the ex-CIA that Eckhart plays here is something he has done many times before. It's right in his wheelhouse.	2015-08-31

If you are a lonely, intellectual or psuedo-intellectual, who dreams of a silent, androgynous-looking sex machine you can abuse emotionally to get back at all the women who rejected you, then this movie will probably be very thought-provoking (and by thought-provoking, I just mean fantasy-fulfilling). If you enjoyed this, I recommend that you learn to love and accept yourself (as you are, not as the God-like, rich, &#34;brilliant&#34;, weirdo that you dream of being) and forgive the women who were mean to you. Good luck to all who enjoyed this movie. I sincerely hope you find peace and true happiness, my friends.	2015-08-31

The actors aren't bad, but the writing is just terrible.

The characters are beautifully portrayed by obviously talented actors. The set is fantastic. While I do not necessarily agree with all of Aaron Sorkin's political views, his writing is poignant and stirs the emotions. I do find it somewhat unrealistic, however, that the news anchor is able to have so many obscure facts so readily available in his memory and at his fingertips to spout in interviews with people promoting views contrary to his own. That said, there are many times my emotions are stirred deeply by the plot and by the characters' reactions to the super-important news stories of the day.	2015-08-31

I personally believe sometimes when an A-list talent like Mr. Crowe  comes out with a highly anticipated movie, that the bar  for the critics and the audience is already somewhat higher from the outset.  So, I believe the playing field is not quite level from the outset when reviewing the film compared with other films of the same ilk.<br /> So, what I believe is a film that is worthwhile and enjoyable has been simply knit picked to death, from what was considered questionable casting of the Emma stone character to the pace of the movie etc.  The bottom line is, this film was enjoyable, well acted and worthy of an audience.<br /> It is simply a fun, lighthearted  well directed romance film that will likely not disappoint 80% of the people that give it a shot.

However, the actor who played the Vicar always walked around with his head down, looking like a sad sacks. I would think a Vicar would be able to express himself and deal with people. This dude can't EVER express himself to anyone. Maybe with another actor who played the role differently, the show would have been more enjoyable.	2015-08-31

There is a ridiculous amount of star power in this film, and the scenes are great.  Really funny if you are musically inclined, especially so if you are a fan of drums.  Power is a unique young man, a young man who still hears the heartbeat of his mother, and feels the need to rock-out and air-drum every chance he gets.  Power has a difficult time fitting in, so goes on a fantastic journey to find a mentor, and finds an equally unique love along the way, a def woman who can feel the music when he is air-drumming.  Along the way, we see how Power's passion and proclivities effect the people in his life.	2015-08-31

It's unlikely that someone who owned a B&B on that much property wouldn't already have been using the property for &#34;events&#34; and such.  The &#34;mean girl&#34; aspect (Zuniga) was over-written; who would accost a property owner with an offer to buy during a funeral, etc.  Still, Zuniga did the best she could with what she was given.  It all comes out well in the end, so if you want a family friendly story that has a happy ending, this might be for you.	2015-08-31

The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967. They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's. Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.	2015-08-31

Extant is an interesting series that is clearly finding it's way during season 1. There is a lot of baseline information that was presented showing what picture they are trying to develop. Some of the actors are a bit weaker than others - likely something that will need to be resolved over time.

Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?	2015-08-31

I will agree to the one starers that it has a slow reveal. However I also feel that too many people have a distorted sense of purpose and will not comprehend this movie. It is great to see CGI only used to support very incredible and prolific symbolism (not intended to depict something realistically- go see Marvel and DC comics for  that which I love as well). I don't want to give anything away like others have and I think you should avoid if you want the full effect of this movie. If you end up suffering through this movie because of my positive review, my apoligies. I am certain this movie is not understood by most.	2015-08-31

It deserved more credit than it received and had it been released at a different time, it would have been a much bigger hit on the silver screen. This movie has awesome effects that are still good on a TV screen but are no comparison to how you would have felt in the movie theater with a huge screen. Even so, the movie kept us at the edge of our seats even on a little computer screen. The plot isn't like the Godzilla movies of old but actually makes sense in a scientific way as presented in this movie. It's a cliff hanger of a movie with characters you will like and characters you will want to smack. That, by the way, is a sign of a good movie when the acting is good enough to arouse emotions both good and bad. So grab the popcorn but go to the bathroom first because once this rocket ship of a movie takes off, you will hate to break the tension by hitting the pause button.	2015-08-31

Not only were they beautifully played, but they were masterworks as well represented as short segments can be. Also, somehow, the playing was not faked (as such scenes often are). I will have to watch the movie again to try and figure out how the scenes were photographed with the 'cello actually being played but seeming to show the actress doing the actual playing. Could it be that the actress was really a 'cellist? The story was wonderful, very convincing, and very inspiring!	2015-08-31

Bizarre, creepy, and so unbelievable I couldn't suspend disbelief. Truly a waste of my time that I will never ever get back.

And what woman who is subjected to this really just wants to be smacked around and seduces at knife point the kid who was hiding in her closet?  STUPID ffilm.	2015-08-31

Our daughter has loved it since about 8 months old, she's a bit over 1.5yo now.  She loves to talk to us about what's going on and of course can say many of the character names.  Combined with us talking to her constantly about what's going on (we don't just park her in front of the TV for extended periods) and the educational nature of the show... our daughter is doing very well developmentally.  Our pediatrician is impressed so I'd definitely recommend sitting down with your kid(s) and watching the show and engaging with them.  I remember the shows from my childhood as well so it has a bit of nostalgia to it.  It does wear thin on adults (my wife and I included) but that's the price of having a child right?  Make the time investment when they are young and you will have a much easier time when they are older.	2015-08-31

Mr. Robot is a very deep and compelling insight into how we process and react to information in a world filled with technology, as based on our previously learned constructs of life.<br />Transversely, it explores the impact of what we previously knew with a view from 'outside the box'.

An added bonus is being able watch actual children create and explain the crafts so we can make them together. Definitely a keeper.	2015-08-31

(Instant Video HAS Captions/Subtitles)	I'm on my second time of viewing this series (since I initially bought the complete set back in 2009/10).  I appreciate that it's free to stream with my PRIME membership, and even better since it offers captions/subtitles which my dvd's do not.<br /><br />Just today I learned something I didn't know before.  I was reading a topic on the &#34;Dr. Quinn&#34; IMDB page, and a fan mentioned that, the order in which the episodes were filmed, is NOT the order that they were aired.  Because of that, there's a continuity issue (events out of order).<br />If you want to view it in the correct order, check out the episode guide (and scroll to the bottom of page): drquinnmd.com/library/episodes1.html<br /><br />As for this show, I love period pieces, and I like the fact that this is pretty much PG rated.  It's becoming increasingly harder to find a period/historical drama with this level of rating, as so many are opting for whatever is shocking, violent, and immoral/raunchy.<br />While &#34;DQMW&#34; tackles some tough issues of the post civil war era, it helps the viewers see them as a sort of abject lesson.<br />It's worth bearing in mind, that the real people and events sometimes portrayed (such as in season 3), are not always accurately depicted.<br />Of course, this isn't meant to be a historical documentary, and as with many other historically based dramas, artistic license comes into play.<br /><br />If you're looking for something similar to watch, I recommend &#34;Christy&#34; (19 ep's), &#34;When Calls the Heart&#34; (ongoing Hallmark series-- 2 seasons & counting), &#34;Road to Avonlea&#34; (7 seasons), and &#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34; (4 seasons).	2015-08-31

I give a 5 star rating because this show was way ahead of it's time... it came out in the mid '60s. The writing, the acting, the concepts were always fresh and clever. It's refreshing that many of the concepts the show dealt with are still relevant, even in 2015, inequality, racism, corruption, xenophobia, etc. (on the show, it's supposed to be the 23rd century). It's also interesting that even though in the series man had mastered space travel and dealt with strange new worlds and sought out new life, etc. In 2015 we have powerful computers and cell phones (just like the communicator in Star Trek) but still have not mastered space travel!

Watch, then think about you.	A great story. Justice was justice.  If you enjoy suspense and mystery and awesome acting this is a treasure. No spoilers here, even if there were something in the movie to spoil. Just watch it, feel it and wonder if you yourself have the capacity to change for the better. If you think you do, don't wait a second, start right now. From my own personal experience I tell you do it now. If you're alone, no friends, no family and no one who cares, specifically yourself. Deep inside of you there is a soul or call it heart, the terminology doesn't matter, but that part wants to live. Dig into that part, do whatever it takes to make people, strangers, those in the medical field or anyone notice you're hurt and broken and that you don't really care. If you keep trying to get someone to notice, a good someone. Someone who enjoys giving instead of taking will see you. It's a long journey from  hell to heaven, it's a hard one, it's exhausting and painful. But the road is there, why stay in Hell any longer than you have to. Jump on that path and go.	2015-08-31

The character Saga from Sweden is unique to police drama; Martin, from Denmark, is a perfect choice of co-worker.  The differences between policing in Sweden and Norway is well drawn; the victim, cut into two parts and placed on the border line,  is part Swedish and part Danish. How to solve a case that crosses borders and involves both society's problems?  The Bridge, a collaborative production effort, is well worth watching.	2015-08-31

Was an excellently produced film but liked the soundtrack in the first one better. The second in this series felt as if something more was left out, but will wait with baited breath for the final film, as I read the entire series in about two weeks & was mezmerized by each one! Perhaps I should have waited to see the films first, but the Divergent left me impatient for more, and Insurgent, while graphically brilliant, didn't do the same for me. The relationship between Tris and Four wasn't as powerful as it appeared in Divergent, or all 3 books, but it still had outstanding moments that gave its audience an urge to stand up & cheer out loud at the screen! (Sorry - no spoilers from me!)<br />The real test will be Allegient's release next year, and the way the writers/director portray its incredible ending to Veronica Roth's genius work! All in all, I still loved the movie (and Shailene Woodley doesn't disappoint either!) so would highly recommend watching it several times to catch all the subtle events going on in the film. Then get yourself to a bookstore and buy this gripping and easy-reading trilogy for an in depth explanation of SO much more that just had to be left on the cutting-room floors! It's WELL worth the read, I can promise you that! Couldn't wait for the next chapter to start!	2015-08-31

With sublime, restrained performances by Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, and a chillingly effective Jeffrey DeMunn, CITIZEN X is an amazingly well crafted and emotional look into how one man's dogged determination to find a killer gains him the grudging respect of his superiors.  Note: some scenes of graphic violence against children and women.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.	2015-08-31

Mia Hall played by Chloe Grace Moretz in &#34;If I Stay&#34;.  Mia is a teenager who's very good with the cello and has the potential to get admitted to Julliard.  She has an slightly older boyfriend, not in high school, who is in a band that is on the verge of breaking out into the big time. Experiencing the comfort of home and fear of an uncharted future when BLAM!  (SPOILER ALERT)  On a snow day there's a car accident that leaves her unconscious/severely  injured and Mom & Dad dead.  Her little brother seems to have gotten the least of it, but nope, he dies too.  While all this is going on she is having an out of body experiences and basically has to decide if she's going to go towards the light like her family.  Who doesn't seem to have been offered that choice.  But then again, we don't see any other out of body people even at the hospital so maybe the audience is only privy to Mia's plight.  Or the other choice that she is reminded of by the living is to fight for life and stay.  That's all I'm going to say about the plot.<br /><br />I generally like this type of movie.  If you don't, even at the free Amazon Prime price you probably won't like It.  You may wanna see &#34;If Only&#34;.  It's even better than this movie is, but it's still the same type.  As you can see by the 4-star rating I did like this movie.  The acting is fine and the story flows well.  So no real negative issues on my part.  If you're on the fence you might as well watch it.	2015-08-31

But the addition of Richard Gere to this cast line up... all I can say is &#34;meh&#34; for his performance, but he at least created a new story line to have these actors follow.  His character just not as believable, or sincere, but the movie concept is still good.  I think this would make a good series instead.  Keep rotating the basic core characters, but bring in and out guest appearances who have different adventures while at the hotel.  Make it about AGING GRACEFULLY!	2015-08-31

My son enjoyed it greatly and I think if you step back and forget the big name bulls*** sci-fi that's out there you will see an enjoyable and action pack flick that you can just enjoy for what it is; a hidden gem in the realm of contemporary sci-fi that is lying in the open.	2015-08-31

It is not the best work for either of them, but it is still a very enjoyable film. It isn't strictly a drama or an action flick, sort of a cross between the two, with drama being slightly ahead. I am not good at synopsis, especially spoiler free synopsis, so I am not going to even try, plus there are reviews here that give an excellent synopsis of the movie. I am not sure of Mirren's age in this, I would guess near 60, possibly even older and yet she still projects  an unbelievable amount  of sex appeal. Even more so than the much younger and one would suppose much sexier Vanessa Ferlito.  Gooding does an excellent job as the conflicted, emotionally stunted man who loves and depends on Mirren. The rest of the cast give excellent performances, and Joseph Gordon-Levett and Mo'nique are not only a hoot of a couple they also make you believe that they are passionately involved. I would recommend it to fans of the actors and to fans of crime and revenge movies.	2015-08-31
US	17975408	REMDS9V4J58OR	B00X5FYC7Y	157175185	What We Do in the Shadows	Digital_Video_Download	4	25	29	N	Y	What happens when you introduce a vampire from the 16th Century to the internet? He googles pictures of the sun.	In a time where Vampires, werewolves, and even zombies are being put through the &#34;Twilight&#34; treatment, stripping them of all their terror and replacing it with lukewarm sex appeal, What We Do In The Shadows takes the desiccated husk of all these poor horror icons and injects them with some humorous new life. Instead of making the monsters terrifying or sexy to braindead underage girls, they give them a sense of humanity and a desire to simply live life like us normal, pre-dead average joes.<br /><br />With talents like Jemaine Clement of Flight of The Conchords in the lead roles, this film is filled with hilarious scenes of blood-sucking, shapeshifting, and in some cases monstrous vampires dealing the the troubles of modern day life. Ever wonder if vampires hate getting blood on the carpet during every meal? Well it's addressed here in hilarious fashion. How does someone who has recently been turned into a vampire essentially &#34;come out&#34; to his best friend while addressing the elephant in the room, that many of his new friends want to eat said best friend? You have the best friend introduce the new vampire friends to the wonders of modern technology! Ever wonder what happens when two vampires have an argument? They turn into bats and fight one another.<br /><br />Simply said, What We Do In The Shadows is a hilarious film brimming with tons of dark humor lightened by the fact that these creatures of the night just want to have a good time and get the rent paid on time.	2015-08-31

I avoided watching this movie for countless years even though it was thrown in my face by every online movie rental organization. Left with nothing really to watch one weekday spent in a hotel room, with hesitation and reluctance, I began watching this movie. There are many quality actors in it and I have to say that unfortunately, Ms. Paltrow is not one of them. (And I do appreciate her talents immensely.) If you're looking for a somewhat, not too girly, romantic movie with plenty of opportunities to laugh, this is it. Bottom line is that I am pleased with my time spent watching this movie.	2015-08-31

Not even cheesy enough to laugh at. Just plain terrible.	2015-08-31

The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.	2015-08-31

Thank you for your consideration.	It was an interesting plot,  but the spoiler came within the first few minutes of the film, so it was not suspenseful at all.  However, the difficulty in accurately portraying what it means to investigate human trafficking was interesting.  The emotional impact on the families of the victims and the investigators appeared to be authentic.	2015-08-31

Just got back from Ireland, hiking with Mountain Sobek.<br />Wish I'd watched Darby O'Gill before I went.<br />Great introduction to a lot of the folklore that we heard about while we were there.<br /><br />Disney's team worked in lots of double entendres though, to the point were Darby O'Gill might be a kink classic.<br />eg Goolge &#34;string of pearls&#34; & &#34;semen&#34; and see what you get.<br />Likewise for &#34;pulling on the rope&#34; & &#34;masturbation&#34;<br />and &#34;butter churning&#34; & &#34;masturbation&#34;.<br /><br />It could be a treasure hunt looking for other double entendres, but those jumped out at me.<br /><br />I'm surprised that this film was directed at little kids in 1959, quite apart from the above there's plenty of drinking, drunkeness, smoking, violence, witchcraft, etc.	2015-08-31

Everyone does a great job if getting their characters right. They all mesh somehow. Even though each character is very different they mesh together seamlessly.

I Liked The Period Aspects	VERY MINOR SPOILERS:<br /><br />Watched the first 4 episodes.<br /><br />Truth be told, I have never been a fan of Edward Burns as an actor.  I thought he butchered the role of Bugsy Siegel.  However, he does have talent in the director/producer/creator departments.<br /><br />Like:<br /><br />Works as a period piece.  Great attention to detail on site selection, dress, etc.  The transition of NYC into the 1960's<br /><br />Dislike:<br /><br />Nothing really new here by way of plot.  Young \\"Turks\\" making a move against the old.  While I like Neal McDonough as an actor, I didn't see him in the role of both \\"black sheep\\" and heir apparent to the Irish mob boss played by Brian Dennehy.  His dialogue seemed stilted and forced.  \\"What did I get, a one way ticket to Palookaville!\\"<br /><br />Rotten Tomatoes gave a \\"Fresh Rating\\" of 81% while Metacritics a rating of 69 (good), though the NY Times gave a score of 40 and called Public Morals \\"a mess\\".<br /><br />Personally, I think that the release timing was brilliant (the small gap between the end of the summer season and the start of the fall season).  Also, I like that the first 4-episodes were released \\"On Demand\\".  While a risky strategy (subsequent to watching the first 4-episodes, one now has to wait a month for new content), I am a fan, as I can generally tell within 4-episodes if I am going to make the commitment to continue watching and if the first 1-2 episodes are slow, I might not wait to watch the 3rd.  I am curious to see what the ratings fall-off will be commensurate with the start of the new fall schedule?<br /><br />While YMMV, Public Morals is worth a look, if for no other reason than the attention to detail in the portrayal of NYC in the early 60's.	2015-08-31

I loved most of the movie, some parts got a little slow but not too bad. I love that they attempted to do something like this. very funny. love how they involved the different character stereotypes, with susan sarandon and kathy bates. very clever. my 7 year old son does the hamburger scene, it took us awhile to figure out what he was doing with his hair and hands...a hoot.	2015-08-31

BOSCH is the best series Amazon Prime has come up with to date.  I look forward to seeing season 2.  I have been a fan of Michael Connelly's books for years now.  I've read all of them and for many years I've wanted to see Bosch on TV, but always had a trepidation on who would play him.  Excellent choice in Titus Welliver.  I can't think of a single role I have not liked him in, whether he be playing bad guy or good.  He does a great job bringing Bosch to life.  Just the right amount of gravitas and strength.  Like I said, can't wait for season 2.	2015-08-31

I have enjoyed both the stars of this show in other works and thought that despite poor reviews and box office, it would probably be at least mildly amusing.<br />The terrible script and editing (they didn't even try) were bad enough but for both lead actresses to fail so miserably was a surprise. These two are capable of very good work but like the editor, didn't even try...and it showed.	2015-08-31

Like the best science fiction programs, Stargate SG-1, creates fantastic worlds and scenarios and relatable human beings confronting seemingly unimaginable situations.

Alex Garland has had a great track record for movies, as I've likes most of what he's written. Sunshine, 28 Days Later, Dredd, all of them are on my list of favorite movies ever. So when I heard about his directorial debut, Ex Machina, I was really looking forward to seeing it. I was going to see it in theaters, but instead I went and watched  Mad Max: Fury Road for the millionth time.<br /><br />I do not regret that decision, especially now.<br /><br />I should say that I rather enjoyed Ex Machina for a majority of its run time. The cinematography is breathtaking, the atmosphere unsettling, and the tone is perfectly cerebral.<br /><br />It's also the single most stupid movie I've seen in recent years. While I said that the film is cerebral, it's more of a feeling than an actual facet of the film's story. This movie wants so hard to be a thought provoking piece of science fiction, and I applaud Garland and company for aspiring to be that, but they failed. Plain and simple. Between the obvious commentary on Google, and the story rehashed from the mother of all artificial intelligence stories: Frankenstein, the film's attempts to look like it's smart betrays its real intelligence. And no amount of sexy female robot nudity is going to help.<br /><br />Without spoiling much of the movie, as I'm sure many wouldn't want it spoiled the general gist of the film is: if you're a jerkass, don't be surprised if the artificial intelligence you create ends up being a jerkass too. That, in and of itself, isn't enough to make this film bad, but I certainly had higher expectations for this film. Maybe that's my fault, though given how amazing a majority of the film is I was expecting a few more twists than the ones the film dished out, and they all ended up being rather predictable.<br /><br />Needless to say, if this film were a computer, and I were the person conducting the Turing Test, I'd fail it. It's still a simulation of something wondrous and amazing rather than the genuine article.article.	2015-08-31

It is always bittersweet for me when a series that I have been involved in for several seasons comes to an end.<br /><br />I knew it was coming; I knew this was the final season.  But you always wonder how it will end...will it leave with a cliff hanger and unanswered questions, or neatly tie things up in a wonderful package so that you can imagine what happens next.<br /><br />I am so very glad that this series did just that!!  I will not say anything further; don't want to spoil anything for those who have not yet watched the series, or the series finale.  But thank you, Falling Skies for the ride!  I can see so much of this as plausible, tho I truly doubt that anything like this will ever really happen.  I think that we as a &#34;civilized&#34; world of humans are more likely to annihilate ourselves before aliens from another universe do it for us!!	2015-08-31

Instead this film tries to fit several genres and doesn't succeed in any of them due to the lack of character development and storyline.<br /><br />There were 4 different stories going on in the movie and none of them seemed plausible or interesting.<br /><br />1. Bradley Cooper returns to Hawiia to prove himself/succeed in business. (His reputation is good enough that he is on this job, and everyone trusts him to handle tricky issues at hand.But all the characters in the movie feel entitled to say what a jerk he is...Huh?)<br /><br />2. Hawiian people are mistreated by the government and conned by Cooper/Murray. (Yeah this storyline really never goes anywhere and seems more a political statement by the writer.)<br /><br />3. The romantic storyline between Stone and Cooper. She is obnoxious and Uncharming. (She is a female Sheldon Cooper.) He seems more interested in his Ex.<br /><br />4. McAdams and Cooper resolving the past and accepting the present. Both seem very happy in their present circumstances, so it made no sense why after 13 years they would meet up. (What drove these 2 characters to come together at that moment versus 13 years ago or 20 years from the present?)<br /><br />And after all the revelations to tie up all 4 plots, everyone is EXTREMELY RELAXED. I would have thought more yard decorations would be decapitated.	2015-08-31

A thoughtful (instead of superhero) quest story that explores the Greeks' relationships with their gods.  Fresh well-done take, which is not easy to do, on characters from several Greek myths.  Matt Frewer as Daedalus is well cast.  If you've ever enjoyed a play by Sophocles, you'll find many of the same themes here.  However, if you're not sure who Sophocles is, this may not be a series for you.  I've read reviews that criticize the special effects--well, I didn't notice problems with them and this series is not really about the special effects.  It pulls the viewer in the old fashioned way--with great dramatic pacing and ideas.	2015-08-31

So its a little shorter then jason bourne on action; but in a way that is critical, realistic. It pictures the reality of what it means to be set up. Not understanding the narrative of the situation, but understanding the need to hunt out, and find a solution, a resolution. Is the daughter a tack on? Absolutely. Does it pay off? Certainly. Other considerations for this movie are not so much on tacky elements, so much as highlighting highly professional and elusive criminal syndicates.<br /><br />A few tactics were over-hung for &#34;heroes&#34; but this movie for me personified a lot of the fear related to the circumstances. You're riding the line of somewhere between crazy idiot and mastermind. Revealing secrets in products and highlighting genuine circumstances of corporate neglect [in some elements] onto more or less complete corporate betrayal. The super-human element stands out for hero, as always. But that said, the scenarios he plays out of are very &#34;real&#34; in a &#34;what would you do?&#34; kind of way.<br /><br />I think the notion of erased/burned was a bit forced on the title, but only because forewarning spoiler: [look away!] cia inside job [k you can look back]<br /><br />For a corporate espionage, and betrayal film there was little investment to care. Not in a lack of the depth of the characters on screen, but the lack of characters that were off. There's always a fourth wall kinda character, and that more or less in parts onto this film an ever convenient taint of daddy slept with other women in the air.<br /><br />Kill a couple hours, you're going to anyway. :p I'd say worth it, but I threw in the towel on expectations at Dad can't work a laundry machine but can figure out how to dissolve sophsticated department of justice lock mechanisms.<br /><br />... I swear I still enjoyed the movie!	2015-08-31

The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.	2015-08-31

What usually ruins a show is when they get away from the action to get deep into the characters.  Blah.  I want believable SCI-Fi action and they deliver.

This had its moments, but from the beginning I felt like I was watching these two doing their impressions of Kristen Wiig and Joaqu&iacute;n Phoenix, and doing it badly. I love Kristen Wiig and her choices of movies, and I really think that Joaqu&iacute;n Phoenix is a good actor, but I can't say the same about these two. Although, Adam Pally is better at it than Sarah Burns is in this, but I have to admit, I have not seen either of them in any other movie (that I am aware of) so I can't really say they are bad actors 100% of the time, only in this. I felt for both of these people they were portraying immediately, I actually cared for them, I had high hopes. About midway through, I stopped caring for her completely, mainly I guess (maybe) it could be that she may actually had been acting so well that her character made me dislike her, but, whatever, I don't think that the makers of this movie wanted that to happen. (The script itself is probably at fault here , so that also means all of those in charge were at fault) In any movie you need to care about the characters, if you go too far and those in charge make you actually stop caring, you are going to be on a very slippery slope, and these slid all of the way down the hill as far as I was concerned. Yes, I do know that Sarah's character was supposed to be this way, but too much is just too much. The character, &#34;Beth&#34; would've been a better choice for Sarah's part, I feel, I liked her more, and she had some acting skills and her and Adam had good chemistry together.<br />The premise for this movie was good enough, I liked the idea, and had it been handled by writers and directors, plus, the actors, just a little better, I would be writing a different review. (I am not a very good reviewer, I only do this if I am 'trying to' help someone either see a good movie, or, stay away from one that may be considered a bad one)<br />Also really, I am not a prude at all, but this had quite a bit of raunchy humor in it that was unnecessary, there is no need to say all of the stuff they said, especially that many times, and I promise, I say those words myself, but for me, in a romantic comedy they should not be raunchy. (That's just how I feel, I am old-fashioned that way) To me, a successful romantic comedy is one like, Sleepless in Seattle, (I know, I know) they did it right, so well in fact, they had immediate copycat movies by others that followed their lead, even the same directors and producers tried to keep that formula going with, You Got Mail!, all to no avail. Still though, SiS did it the way it should be, no really bad words, and it was romantic, but to shove literal bathroom humor into a movie that wants to make history (like SiS did) or entertain us, or make one want to watch it over and over again.

(That's just how I feel, I am old-fashioned that way) To me, a successful romantic comedy is one like, Sleepless in Seattle, (I know, I know) they did it right, so well in fact, they had immediate copycat movies by others that followed their lead, even the same directors and producers tried to keep that formula going with, You Got Mail!, all to no avail. Still though, SiS did it the way it should be, no really bad words, and it was romantic, but to shove literal bathroom humor into a movie that wants to make history (like SiS did) or entertain us, or make one want to watch it over and over again.

I appreciate the bleak characters-scape, dark tones that color the urban frames, collision of story lines, over the top shoot-outs, emotion-less world views and poignant moments of heart-breaking closeness, but it's a more of an emotional ramble than anything else. Gotta be in the mood, I guess.	2015-08-31

Brenda Blethyn is one of my favorites, especially in her series, Vera.  Hillary Swank is great, and should have received better recognition for her work,especially in the movie, The Homesman.<br /><br />Is it possible that this movie, Mary and Martha  received little attention because it deals with real life and really tough problems?The same could be said of the movie,  The Homesman.  It dealt with people's lives in truly difficult times and conditions.  Maybe we just fail to appreciate talent when it presents to us the gritty aspects of human existence.<br /><br />The story of Mary and Martha allows us a close insight to the grief of personal loss, suffered by each of these two remarkable women.  None of us enjoy sorrow, or tragic loss of a young person.  Stories such as this help us somehow to understand such loss apart from our own heartaches.<br /><br /> I am glad this story was based on a real Martha and her real son, Harry, who died of malaria while working with children in Africa.  I wish the Martha character had been given a more active part in the development of the story for television.  Time constraints have to be considered.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for all,especially women.	2015-08-31

Confusion on the behalf of the authorities in the movie was an example of too many bosses with their own agendas who were unable to focus on the morality and ethics of conducting the interview. It is a stretch of the imagination to believe that one person could control people with  such psychobabble and cult craft. (Spoiler) Revenge is served up on a platter of martyrdom.	2015-08-31

My husband and I are in our 60's living in Texas, but still we thoroughly enjoy this series about a California high school girl who can't resist solving mysteries. She is certainly not Nancy Drew.

An accident occurred on stage were Charlie was hung. Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler)  joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.<br /><br />The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films.  We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming. I liked it. The problem I had with the twist is that there is a &#34;discovery&#34; of things that happened 20 years ago, secrets I didn't think would exist in a small town where everybody knows everyone's business.<br /><br />Guide: 1 whispered F-bomb.

I really enjoy the story, and character developing, photography etc. However, I'm kinda getting sick of the raunchy nature of the script, with strong mysogynistic in your face scenes.

Acting was superb, as was the cinematography, enjoyed the father daughter interaction, thought their science was a little too convenient about the benevolent alien intelligence putting a teseract in a black hole to solve their issue with time distortion -- and the fight scene was just too much, too bad we were in another galaxy or we could have had a car chase or a gun fight, otherwise a great movie.	2015-08-31

Because Creative Galaxy and Tumble Leaf have been moderately good, I thought we'd give Wishenpoof a try even though I was already turned off by the image of a waif-ish thin girl with the teensiest button nose.  It's a shame that we can't do for girl characters what we do for boys - just make them engaging, likable and confidently solving problems and exploring and interacting with the world.  Instead girlhood is depicted like its a problem to be overcome with some belief in yourself and effort.  This is NOT a helpful message but comes off as an assumption that all girls need some sort of remediation from being girls. When the character of Bianca breaks into a ballad within each episode it would be nice if her singing voice actually sounded like a child's and not a grown woman's. Again, confusing and invalidating to young girls.	2015-08-31

By the time I finished viewing Season 1, I was thoroughly enthralled with these families.  I love anything about British culture and as much as I love Downton Abbey its nice to view a series about present day Brits.  The episodes are very well written and I'm always disappointed when its over.  An hour flies by!  I would highly recommend this series.	2015-08-31

Season 1 you were hooked and Season 2 didn't disappoint with its intrigue	Season 1 started out a bit weird and slow but by the end of Season 1 you were hooked and Season 2 didn't disappoint with its intrigue .  Season 3 just goes off the weirdness deep end. The plot/storyline is full of holes and dead ends.  The characters have become less believable and the show is re-using themes and have been overused in the sci-fi realm.  The whole thing feels like a cut-rate &#34;B&#34; movie.  You sure don't get the feeling that there are &#34;thousands&#34; in Chester's Mill as is stated several times in episodes in this season. The season suffers from continuity errors -- a cut shirt in one scene is fully repaired in another occurring within minutes of each other.  For having a 6 inch metal rod shoved through her thigh and almost bleeding to death, Julia has made an amazing recovery, running through the forest without a hitch. I would vote that the dome just contract to a singularity and put us all out of our misery.	2015-08-31

I am not a Shakespeare expert, but am familiar with many of his plays through college classes, theater, and movies.  I find the information presented in these shows extremely interesting - whether it be the historical context of the work or the interviews with current actors on how they gain inspiration for their characters.  You can watch these over and over to focus on elements you may have not explored in depth the previous time.  Watching these will inspire you to re-read a play or go to the theater to experience it live.	2015-08-31

It goes so far as making the science minded Loomis(Ejiofor) seem like a bumbling idiot. Ann played by Robbie acts as if she's a 12 year old girl trapped in an adult woman's body, yet Caleb(Pine) and Loomis say &#34;she acts a lot older for her age.&#34; Also, there wasn't a single person named Zachariah in the movie. 1/10	2015-08-31

An accident occurred on stage were Charlie was hung. Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler)  joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.<br /><br />The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films.  We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming. I liked it. The problem I had with the twist is that there is a &#34;discovery&#34; of things that happened 20 years ago, secrets I didn't think would exist in a small town where everybody knows everyone's business.<br /><br />Guide: 1 whispered F-bomb. No sex or nudity.	2015-08-31

Overall a fun movie - fairly high production values and a fantastic cast that is, unfortunately, kind of wasted on a script that seems underdeveloped (to put it kindly).

The information about this woman was presented in a slightly different manner that I found illuminating and...well... it's a strange word for this dreadful topic, but 'entertaining' as well.  I remember reading about this woman as I did my research for the book I wrote on Belle Gunness.  There were two other ladies in London doing this, too...and way too many orphanages in the U.S. allowing children to die, either of disease or starvation.  We think of the Victorian/Edwardian age as a time of high morals by the middle class. We're very wrong.	2015-08-31

While everyone was disappointed with the Pilot, I felt it was right where it needed to be. The Pilot shows the build up of characters and it shows the outer surroundings of what is expected during an epidemic. This is a completely different setting with too much going on. That is how life really is and realistic patterns during a crisis. People must not remember much about the Pilot to Walking Dead. The first episode was spent watching Rick walk around and figure out why he's so isolated. Where is everyone?  It was centered on him. In addition, we had no idea how it happened. We just knew there were Zombies.  While the audience is aware of there being zombies in this show, the characters aren't certain what exactly this &#34;virus&#34; is and what it does. The writers can't really go full blazing with zombies. That wouldn't set up the story right into seeing how things develop slowly. I'm certain this show will  take the spotlight in due time. I'm excited to see the last episode of this season. You can only go up from here.  They need this to carry on this show for all the Walking Dead viewers. If anyone has read the comics, everyone knows how the book will end and what the outcome can possibly be.	2015-08-31

While this story had some interesting twists, turns, and misdirection, much of it was just plain creepy.  Perhaps that's what the director was going for, but I found it to be somewhat cringe-inducing.

My husband, sons and I absolutely love this series on innovative science projects that solve societal/technological problems!  These 3-5 minute films give just enough information to introduce the viewer to the problem & solution, and they leave the viewer wanting to learn more about science.  Our favorite film is titled &#34;Meet Mr. Toilet.&#34;  Mr. Jack Sims presents the serious problem, lack of access to toilets, in such a humorous but informative manner.  Another great film is &#34;The Secret of Trees.&#34;  We are amazed how a 13-year old invented a way to harness solar energy by aligning solar panels in the same pattern as leaves on trees.  The leaves follow the  Fibonacci Sequence, a recurring mathematical formula in nature.  Yet another is &#34;You don't know Jack.&#34;  This film showcases the research by another teenager who is fervently working on developing a cure for pancreatic cancer.  We need more programming like this to inspire youth to pursue creativity in science.  We can't wait to watch Season 2!	2015-08-31

What emerges are the most creative, talented, inciteful, resourceful, deep thinking individuals I have ever seen. Makes you really wonder how life could have been for them had things been different.

But even when I do my level best to be unbiased, this is a bad, bad movie.  The CGI was so over the top it was distracting. The constant forced references to the original property never felt natural or organic, flowing from the action.  Instead, each was a jarring reminder that &#34;hey look, we're part of a long-running franchise&#34;.  Megan Fox's acting was cringe-worthy at best, the action sequences felt like a video-game, the dialog was atrocious, etc.<br /><br />I know I'm really not the target audience for this, my 10 year old kid who'd never been exposed to the turtles before loved the film, and it made a boatload of money, but we watched this &#34;for free&#34; on Prime and I definitely feel that I overpaid.  Sorry kids, this film sucks	2015-08-31

But ultimately it doesn't deserve these positive reviews. Its not nearly as deep as it claims to be, and really the entire plot is a long-winded whine. The acting is quite good throughout, especially Bill Hader. However the storytelling is so contrived. Its as if whomever made this movie first sat down with the title in mind, came up with an entire movie based on the title, and never really went further than adding obvious symbolism. At the end I could only think, &#34;Does this story really need to be told?&#34; It's the kind of plot you'd find from that boring co worker who complains about every facet of his dull life. Maybe it's just me but I can't watch a movie where something bad happens to the lead and then they mope about for the next 70 minutes.	2015-08-31

Then they would sell the movie to audiences based on the star appeal rather than the content of the film. Most of this genre stunk something awful. (I'm looking at you, New Year's Eve) But Love Actually really delivers. It's an anomaly.<br /><br />It is still a bunch of actors crammed into small roles with a loosely connected story line.<br /><br />But the theme of each mini story is the same, that love is strong and takes on many different forms. You can love your wife, love your best friend, love your family, love a girlfriend, love someone you cant' have, love someone you can have, love your kids, love your country, etc etc etc. Some love is easy and fun (The Prime Minister and his girlfriend) some love is hard (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's marriage) and some love is down right painful (Laura Linney caring for a mentally ill brother).<br /><br />Each story comes back to that theme in the end, that no matter what else is going on in life and no matter how bad the world seems, there is love all around us. It's everywhere, and it's not hard to find. All you have to do is open your eyes to look for it.<br /><br />However, count me on the side of people who think that Andrew Lincoln's character was WAY out of line to go to Keira Nightly's house shortly after she's married to Lincoln's best friend to profess his undying love for her. That's not sweet. That's not cool, man. That's some low down home wrecking stuff there. People are split 50/50 on this scene. Some people think it's really sweet. But the truth is that he's unburdening his soul at the risk of damaging his best friend's marriage. That's not good. That's selfish.	2015-08-31

US	48134466	R2TQSEX4IANBRZ	B00I0Q3BE8	828187895	Petty Romance	Digital_Video_Download	4	1	1	N	N	Nothing Petty about PETTY ROMANCE	In PETTY ROMANCE director Kim Jung-hoon takes a standard romantic pairing of potential lovers to establish the oddly compelling parameters of success in the adult comic trade.  Jeong Bae (Lee Sun-kyun) is a struggling artist in the manga (called &#34;manhwa&#34; in Korea) world of sex and violence comic books. He learns of a contest with a first prize of $100,000 USD. The only problem is that Jeong Bae needs a script writer to complement his artistic skills. He interviews various candidates, all of whom do not exactly fit into his scheme of a hero who can combine manga type sex and violence into a winning formula.  Enter Han Da-rim (Choi Kang-hee) whose own sleazy background is acceptably graphic. The romance of the film begins with the inevitable bickering between her vision of a hero and his. She sees Jeong Bae as one who is locked into a losing image of commercial manga art whereas he sees her as too graphic (if one can be so in manga) to work with. Much of PETTY ROMANCE is replete with manga style animation with a stylized female assassin fetchingly clad as she slices and dices her way through legions of hapless victims.  There is little doubt however that this bickering will by the closing credits lead to a satisfying climax of personal and professional success. There is nothing petty about PETTY ROMANCE. The leads bounce off each other in ways that seem somehow real despite the unreality of their linking professions.  One can sense that PETTY ROMANCE is a fine example of a Hollywood style romance of the 1930s that is just as entertaining today in Korea as Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn were in their heyday.	2015-08-31

Daniel Radcliffe was very good in this movie and it was a complete departure from his Harry Potter days. He's really proving to be quite the dramatic actor. Michael C. Hall plays charismatic creepy very well and I enjoyed this story. I had no idea the particulars of the story when I watched it, other than it was about real life poets and authors. Lucien was a brilliant sociopath and whoever played him did a marvelous job as well. It's not an action packed movie, despite being about a murder, but it's cerebral and an interesting glimpse into the lives of these iconic people.	2015-08-31

Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34;  Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?	2015-08-31

At first, once I got hooked, I couldn't figure out why. But after a while I realized that a major reason is the dialogue. The writers have a flair for language, and the actors deliver their lines with panache. One remarkable thing about the show is the amazingly fresh turns of phrasing by the main characters, especially the character of Boyd Crowder, one of the most likeable sociopaths you'll ever see. He's also highly educated and so smart that he's probably a genius. But no less a genius is Raylan Givens, the solid lawman and US Marshal. I also love the characters of the Kentucky backwoods like Dicky and his mom, Lady Bennett, and also the loveable goofy criminal, Dewie Crow.Try this show, and see if you don't get hooked, too. Poetry, drama, violence ... what more could one want in a show?	2015-08-31

Season 3 has been my favorite so far. The noir style is beautiful, specifically with the costuming (Dr. Bloom and Bedelia's especially). I thought no one could potray Hannibal like Hopkins did...until I watched Mikkelson resurrect the character with profound respect for the source material. The highlight of season 3 l, though, has to be Gillian Anderson as Bedelia. Never have I been so enamored and perplexed with a character than I am with her. She truly believes that she has found moral high ground, all the while participating in her &#34;husband's&#34; carnage with no apologies or remorse. You would think she's just doing what she has to to survive, but her behavior once she leaves Florence proves that she has the same monster inside her that Hannibal does, she has just learned to tame the beast, making her all the more dangerous. Great show. So sorry it was canceled. Here's hoping Netflix picks it up.	2015-08-31

Rusty (Ed Helms) is grown and an airline pilot for a small airway. When the neighbors are over for dinner, he sees an enormous amount of father-son bonding, that he become envious and realizes his family is in a rut. He decides a vacation to Wally World (and not Paris) is what the family needs and announces to the audience &#34;The new vacation will stand on its own.&#34;<br /><br />His family is a bit dysfunctional.  We discover his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) was known as &#34;Debbie do anything&#34; in college. As a side note, I don't believe there is a Memphis State University, but the University of Memphis is a dry campus. Kevin (Steele Stebbins) the younger son swears excessively, wrestles, and likes to bully his older brother James. James (Skyler Gisondo) who &#34;doesn't have a vag.., but it would be okay if he did&#34;, keeps a wish diary.<br /><br />The film was funny. The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.<br /><br />Guide:  Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity.	2015-08-31

A great  romantic period piece... probably the best one I've seen in a long time... I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie.  The main characters of the movie end up together because despite their misfortunes & shortcomings they are alike in their character... their work ethic , passion and love and caring for other people eventually put them on the same path... the stronger of the two patiently endures but retains dignity and  makes it clear that a decision must be made or the two of them must take different paths.	2015-08-31

In almost every story, the period of discovery is my favorite. Because I have watched the sister show since day one, I was looking forward to seeing the time we missed while Rick was out cold. This did not disappoint. FTWD has a fresh feel with the new set to g, and teenage characters. The grownups are interesting too, the the female protagonist has had a few high profile roles lately such as House of Cards that get in the way for me. Great writing though so it works.	2015-08-31

The result is a Heller-esque tale replete with absurdities and inanities of military servitude.  It took a woman to tell this story.  Unlike other military movies, this one is almost entirely female - other than two smaller parts that come to mind, girls rule here.<br /><br />Lavie's script stitches together three loosely connected tales: &#34;01: The Replacement&#34;; &#34;02: The Virgin&#34; and &#34;03: The Commander&#34;. The constant in the three stories is the presence of Dana Ivgy as Zohar. Ms. Ivgy is a personal favorite dating back to [[ASIN:B000255L98 Broken Wings]]. She's a great actress and an arresting on screen presence even when dressing down or meant to be bristly and difficult like she is here.  Ivgy shines brightest in Lavie's 2nd story as the title character.<br /><br />The movie' surprise, though, is Nelly Tagar as Daffi.  She plays a big part in the first story, ostensibly training her replacement as she angles for reassignment in Tel Aviv. Tagar is a naturally gifted physical comedienne with fun, expressive eyes.  Her ability to cry on contact plays a big part in the story and to watch her to do it with aplomb -- and have you chuckle at the results -- is a real treat.  I was saddened to see her not appear n the second tale, but excited to see her return in the third and finale story, whose title -- The Commander -- is a neat little head fake from Lavie.<br /><br />The third star turn in the film is that of Shani Klein as Rama, a commander and boss to Zohar and Daffi.  I really liked Ms. Klein in this role.  Her Rama is a thin sheen of bluster with a sensitive core underneath. Zohar doesn't see it, but the audience can.	2015-08-31

The film starts you off in the middle of some action drama and through-out the whole experience makes you want to know what happens next.<br /><br />These type of stories and films are really more so short stories in my opinion that are great for viewing at least once. You get connected just enough to care if a character makes it to the end but at the same time you feel like you wanted a little more out the film.<br /><br />This is definitely a adult film in terms of content and the action scenes and don't recommend it for family viewing.<br /><br />Trying to keep this short; I wanted more from the film but at the same time I was satisfied enough with the content not to rage about it.	2015-08-31

Bradley Cooper has just the right combination of the 'Everyman' morphing into pure intellectual power with the help of a mysterious designer drug. Abby Cornish and Robert DeNiro provide superb performances; with Mr DeNero in particular providing an understated, yet compelling role as a business tycoon.  Cooper's transformation from a slacker copywriter into super investment analyst show the full range of his actor's range, while demonstrating the vulnerabilities and missteps of Eddie Spinaola a &#34;regular guy&#34;, reeling from the intense pressure of his transformation.<br /><br />While the screenplay deviates from the novel, it retains much of the intense pace and hyper realism of the original.

Goverment appears nonexistent, police are either stormtroopers or looking out for themselves, and the media are limited to the few seconds of screen time and only in passing. There are no interviews with police, firemen, paramedics or witnesses, a riot occurs and only one camera is out to record it. Hundreds of other cell phones stay in pockets, no one tweets or post to social media. The characters must be on a plan with no data, no text and very limited minutes because they only call on occasion and don't bother to convey any useful information. When bit the victims seem content to sit and die if there is no answer on 911. To summarize the social and civil milieu is not remotely believable. I won't comment on the characters as they are already taking a beating. I can suspend disbelief for zombies but the rest is asking too much.	2015-08-31

We sure need someone who can change the course with new genres altogether with little to do with cops, detectives, emergency rooms and doctors. I have the feeling that because reality programs and cop/legal/detective/doctor/ER shows have an adequate audience that programmers believe that's all there is. WRONG!. So, if you (ho hum) would like to watch another cop show (I don't care what minute twist is involved), then I would recommend it.

The acting is good and there is a decent plot.  Larry's humor is at its best... He's a local Deputy Sheriff protecting a &#34;witness&#34; who is being held by bogus witness protection guys.  The witness is a lady who starts out being snooty and offensive, but, after a while with Larry, she turns out to be a likeable, compliant companion to Larry who is attracted to her but who remains loyal to his girl back home... This may be the best of the Larry &#34;movies.&#34;  The supporting actors are really good.	2015-08-31

Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?	2015-08-31

Even Kat Denning's Jovian bust size can't save this mediocre &#34;quriky horror comedy.&#34; I put those words in quotations because this film wishes it was really a quirky horror comedy, rather than the mess of utter lameness it is. Its attempts at being clever fall flat, as it desperately clings onto the annoying indie comedy tropes that make the genre insufferable rather than ingenious comedy.<br /><br />If you want a funny horror comedy, go watch Odd Thomas, cause I'm sure the makers of this film certainly liked both the book and the film.	2015-08-31

I thought Dave Franco really made this movie. He had an awkward humor  which I truly enjoyed watching. I did not know that Vince vaungh was so tall and Dave Franco was so small! I liked the message this movie portrayed of how to never give up on your dreams keep going for what you believe In. Their also was another message on how bullying has now gone beyond school with social media's sites giving bullies the opportunity to continue their behavior after school hours.cWhich makes it hard for parents to help their child who is being bullied find a solution.  But, what Vince Vaungh told his son made perfect sense to stand out, be different. You do not want to be like everyone else. Overall I really enjoyed watching this film.	2015-08-31

The trailer worked fine, but on the movie itself, the picture was behind the audio track so it was like watching the characters lip synch, BADLY, throughout the whole movie.  It wasn't just a couple seconds either, but like 10 seconds behind, so they were onto the next scene sometimes in the audio, but you would see the actors mouthing what the other actors had said in the last shot.  It made the story really hard to follow.  I thought maybe it was my TV, but then I tried another Amazon rental and the audio/picture on that one worked just fine, it was just this movie.  I even tried logging out and back in and unplugging and plugging. I gave it my best shot to fix it on my own, but unfortunately, nothing worked.  Its too bad too b/c it looked like a great movie!	2015-08-31

I got bored and turned the TV off after 20 minutes of the very first episode. I am so glad that I tried again, because I have totally enjoyed every episode. Season two gets more involved in the deep personal issues of the key characters on both sides. All I ask for from my TV is to take me away for a while. I certainly would not want to be in any of these characters' life situations, but it's fun to watch it.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that are offended by the sex and language.

I was more a fan of groups like The Beatles and Rolling Stones. I recently saw The Cowsills perform with The Happy Together Tour and then became curious as to their &#34;story&#34;.  I enjoyed this documentary very much.  I discovered that I am the same age as Susan but with only one older brother. She was fortunate to have so many. It made me sad to hear of yet another controlling father and husband. That was so typical of that era.  I am sad for all the losses they went through but happy that Paul, Susan and Bob are still playing together.  I'm glad I got to see the three of them perform and hear their story.  Whether you are a fan or not I think you will enjoy seeing this documentary.	2015-08-31

This was another Spartacus, 300 attempt in making something lasting, however the characters are not developing at all. This series has a good idea of what it wants, but no idea on how to get their. The only character worth enjoying is Daedalus the Inventor. Every other character is mediocre at best. This series was a let down, no surprise there, only because it seems to be trying to hard to become something it will never be with that type of cast. it has a very long way to go and I don't think it will get there. This series needs better actors and better plots and storylines. The main character is not even believable. Sorry guys better luck on another series.	2015-08-31

My biggest and minor complaint about the realism is when they had Molly supposedly hitting 4 bullseyes with the pistol after never having fired one before.  The characters, including that of Ethan the Android Humanich son , JD the former cop, and .Molly Woods (played by Halle Berry), the former astronaut and now hybrid, are all interesting.        After watching all 11 episodes of Season 2, I am even more impressed than after season 1.  Several actors/actresses and their characters were very engaging.  The projections of future technology in Extant ,which appears to be at least 20 years into the future,such as even more ubiquitous surveillance and recording of everything and the quantum leap in AI were all believable.  The intelligence shown by the World Threat Assessment master computer and the humanichs--androids with the very nearly exact appearence of humans--is very impressive but not so extreme as to be ridiculous or even highly unlikely.  I liked the profile of the hybrid human-aliens as being generally peaceful but with some hostility to humans.  The escape of the alien spores containing the DNA of an alien race about to be wiped out from some unspecified global catastrophe and then by infecting/mating with humans--is a pretty imaginative mutation on the familiar Superman/Supergirl escape from Krypton.   Among the more progressie,non-male-chauvanist high points in character development, was the roughly 60 year-old woman Secretary of HomeSec, the future Dept. of Homeland Security, Fiona Stanton, played by Kate Burton, who was an earthy, tough boss every bit as intimidating as a macho male boss would be, yet a fair person.  While there may be a minor problem with some perhaps gratuitous sex thrown in such as in the ubiquitous cleavage displayed by Berry, which is a good hook for heterosexual males, Berry succeeds in evoking a wide and deep range of emotion, ranging from wisecracking to extreme anger and irespressible independance to great sadness and affection.  Although JD Richter, the detective and on-demand cop played by J Dean , was initially a bit off-putting with his loose sexual behavior, he  progressively is shown to be a very good and honest human being with courage and whose &#34;problem with authority&#34; helps Molly to be able to escape from the federal /global authorities trying to stop her from figuring out and revealing how the alien invasion/landing has inadvertantly led to what looks like murders of young pregnant women.  His down-to-earth detective skills is a realistic and welcome departure from all the cyber-sleuthing that is the predominant form of investigation/intelligence in this future world.	2015-08-31

In the future if we can extract the neural patterns  from one brain for learning a concept, we will then be enabled to share these learning experience patterns by transmitting these function directly to a concerned region of brain .. Then Voila, instant learning .this is showed in the Matrix movies as science fiction, we can make it a reality in the near future.20 - 50 years.<br />I should differentiate  between digital and Artificial conscious AC . AC has a robotics component that can be applied to kill. This is a real moral issue and I am totally against it.<br />So your technology can refocus to the new emerging Market of DC we can build super digital entities that will never harm the human race and we can also augment the cognitive abilities such as awareness and learning with no more moral issues.<br />Hassan Khorshid	2015-08-31

I was led to believe that it was mainly a historical movie about my hometown, Albany, NY.  It was filmaed in  here, but it was a story of what people went through during that time, anywhere.  It is a great movie and worth watching.	2015-08-31

Also the sound track was off.  The pictures were behind the dialog by a few seconds.  Very disconcerting.  Besides the technical glitch, the plot was stupid, where were that lead girl's parents.

The wonderful Janet McTeer is wasted on ...	Worth watching for Fiennes' performance. He is as compelling as he would go on to be in Schindler's List and the remake of Red Dragon.  Binoche is less successfully cast as Cathy. French accent gets in the way and her part could have been better written. The wonderful Janet McTeer is wasted on this Nelly Dean, reduced here to a bit of a cipher. If you really want the full Wuthering experience, McTeer's reading of the book available on Audible is not to be missed.  The book is hellishly difficult to capture well on film. It is much darker, and the psychology of the characters much more complex, than even this version conveys, and it does try. Some have praised the music. I thought it cliched, over the top and intrusive.	2015-08-31
