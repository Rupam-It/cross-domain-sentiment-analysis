1,I loved it and I wish there was a season 3... I watched season 2 and loved that as well!
1,"As always it seems that the best shows come from England. best of the best without words, i cant wait to watch season two."
1,"This movie isn't perfect, but it gets a lot of things right. Yes, the librarian character played by Marcia Gay Harden is stereotypical and played a bit heavy-handed. But the universal nature of the story, the beautiful setting, and the likability of the characters overcome this flaw. The quote at the end brought tears to my eyes.  If you want to take a break from Hollywood's standard fare of dark, violent, or stupid movies, then give this a try. It is is entertaining and thoughtful."
1,excellant this is what tv should be
1,Brilliant film from beginning to end. All of the performances across the board are flawless. Doesn't get much better than this.
1,If you don't like this show. Go back to your nickelback cd's you heathen
1,Very funny.  A typical mid 50's comedy.
1,"Strange as it is, it was not as good as the series.  While it is a good movie, it could have been done better."
0,"Funny shows! We laughed out loud, alot!"
1,Well made. Great actors! Christopher Walken makes an appearance..always a joy. Tad boring at times..stuffy would be a better word. But NOT a waste of time by any means...
1,This show is awesome..cant wait til next season!!
1,A good perspective.  I appreciate the movie.
1,this saga gets better as the seasons go along still some soap opera moments but is a good watchable show
1,Great show.
0,"Not my kind of movie, one star was too much"
0,I would have given it a 4 but since I can't get seasons 4 & 5 I might have to adjust my thinking.
1,I loved it.
1,I want to like it--but the storylines are a bit thin.
1,If you're a sucker for supernatural series then you'll enjoy this one. Not only does it have demons and creatures but it throws in a CSI like feel in each episode.
1,Well done!!  Great show....
1,:)
1,Great non-stop action thriller. Very Addicting.
1,"At first I thought this was a copy of Atlantis, from the BBC.  It's a little hokey and this is not the best implementation of virtual sets I have ever seen, but I was surprised by the end of the show.  Towards the middle of the season I was resigned to the fact this was just another ho-hum program I could background-watch.  But the end of the season is slightly different from standard formulas and it piqued my interest just enough for 3 stars."
1,Interesting!
1,A great  series.  Wish there were more episodes.
1,Great show
1,Very good movie.
1,My ten year old loved it.
1,Continues to be a good show.
1,Enjoyed season two almost as much as season one. Interesting story lines and characters. Binge-worthy!
1,Enjoying rewatching. Watch as PBS program and again on Prime. Will continue to do so.
1,"I've always wanted to say and do some of the same things as Larry David does in this show. Embarrassing results follow Larry, and It is hilarious!"
1,story line a bit thin
1,Really enjoyed this pilot.  Hope they make it into a series.
1,Very funny.
1,Fun and poignant.  Great characterization and portrayal of a Transgender person by Jeffrey Tambor and everyone  in the cast.
1,Favorite &#34;worst movie.&#34;
1,Takes a look at a discrimination against homosexuals that effects the hetero population. Highly recommend.
1,"Great movie, but anything Ann Hathaway is in is bound to be good."
1,too much of unbeivelable thing but it is good int
1,Good documentary. Watch this first before watching the Sean Penn movie.
1,"Great, I have to keep from watching all of the episodes at one setting"
1,Great Show!!!
1,The British know how to make good mysteries. This one is very well done and entertaining.
1,"Was never too interested in watching an Amazon series. I watched the pilot for Sneaky Pete because it seemed interesting, and you can't go wrong with Giovanni Ribisi.  I am very glad I did.  I'd love to see this come out in the same format as Netflix to allow for binge watching, but I will be following this series closely.  Highly recommended."
1,"This is a great series, can't waite to see the next season!"
1,"With a genre as saturated as the American western, it can be difficult to reinvigerate the brand. This film manages to do just that. Or does it? Revolving around the timeless and satisfying dynamic of the &#34;revenge tale&#34;, the movie runs in a fairly predictable pattern. The real character, and the real appeal of the film comes through in some spectacular cinemetography and visual effects. Detail has never been so looked after. From the costumes to the weapons to the set design, one never feels incomplete immersion. Casting was a pleasant surprise here. Mikkelsen plays his lead in the same sincere and intense manner that he always does. And there in may lie the secret here. The entire film smacks of a quiet desperation and some grim certainties that underscore frontier life in the western territories. All in all, there is little to detract from the action, save for the tired and ever staling idea that fossil fuel is the downfall of civilization. See There Will be Blood, etc. All in all, the film was well acted and nicely shot. Definitely worth a look, and must have on Blu-Ray or other HD format."
1,Love this video - very helpful - got me thinking about all kinds of combinations!
1,great show
1,"This young actress  is one to watch out for! I first saw her in the vampire horror film, &#34;Let's me in&#34;. The film was kind of a chick flick, however I loved all the references to punk rock and classical music."
1,It's a great series I would expect everybody to watch it and I can't wait till four
1,Sort of reminded me of a Woody Allen movie.  Good acting but ended abruptly like they just got tired and quit.
1,Good memories.
1,what a way to end it!
1,Really enjoyed this. Great cast crew and story. Looking forward to more!!
0,Like many other viewers I felt the Family edition was a failed project. I watch the series for the International settings and was disappointed that much of season 8 was based in the US.
1,Great show it really keeps you involved. I can't wait for the next season!
1,Great movie with lots of action.
1,ended in a dumb spot but it was ok i guess
0,Could Not Get to work on my Samsung TV - or  blue ray player  -  or through my computer  Will Try again another rainy day in near future
0,You can just go so far with the message that we can all learn valuable lessons from handicapped persons and the bible without crafting a believable story with believable characters.
1,"I watched it. I believe it. And I acted on it by getting out of some of my stocks before September 15, 2015,"
1,Not to keen on the video. At least theres an effort put forth. I would of liked to see some before and after pictures at least. Not to much in helpful information for ten bucks.
1,Gripping drama!
1,This show was amazing. Too bad it got cancelled.
1,Still very good......  waiting for season 5 to get on Prime.....
1,"The best of the best art, astonishing artist and production. Unique point of view for each artist featured on the show."
1,"Gritty, raw, real.  One of the best things on TV."
1,A tremendous series
1,Great
1,It is ok but do my wow to me<br /><br />Thank you
1,Season 2 finds the world embroiled in WWII. It brings many changes to Downton Abbey as well as to each of the characters. The filming is exquisite. The characters are interesting and the actors have become some of my favorite. I only wish it was going to continue beyond season6. Buy all the seasons. It's wonderful viewing and worth owning to watch again and again.
1,"Best TV ever. Magnificent writing, directing, acting and character development.  I wish it would go on weekly."
1,Just an amazing cast!!!
1,"Sad, but eye opening. So easy to loose sight of the human need for worth and dignity in the progress of technology. Well done."
1,"Really great show, didn't expect the ending."
1,really enjoyed the programs they had good plots
1,"If you know Albert Brooks, you know his comedy is dry.  It's not for everyone, but I get a kick out of him.  Debbie Reynolds absolutely makes this movie an enjoyable way to spend an hour and 44 minutes of your time.  It's slow to start but stick with it because once Miss Reynolds hits the screen, it becomes a truly wonderful film with lots of laughable moments...especially if you have older parents who struggle with technology, or acquire quirky habits like freezing every form of food under the sun.  I waited and waited for this film to become available on Amazon Prime but it never showed up.  So I finally bought a digital copy to keep in my collection and am so happy I did."
1,My favorite show of all time!
1,My Children love this show.
1,Who doesn't like gangster shows?
0,"While watching the trailer for this film it states that this is a documentary about a mans journey visiting Jamaica, once you rent the film it gives a small history of what you are about to see.  At this time it states that the film maker decided this material was to spiritual to share and he decided to put all of the content on the shelf.  Only about ten minutes of the film is with someone interviewing people about the haunted history of the island and the rest of the film is merely advertising another film project."
1,Victorian &#34;tech&#34;
1,"excellent! witty, well-directed and acted. Very enjoyable movie."
1,very well done
1,Excellent
1,One of the early movies of her career. Good story. Enjoyed it.
1,Great movie. Should have a higher star rating than it does but it has some plot twists that are not your standard &#34;happy feel good&#34; twists that most people want to see. We love it!
1,Another well done Cohen Bros movie.  Kevin Bacon did a great job playing and looking the part as a crooked cop.
1,Awesome movie
1,Great twists.<br />Love the characters. The story writers for this show are awesome!  Can't wait for the next season!
1,Fun to see some of the self proclaimed badasses tap out
1,If not for game of thrones it would be the greatest series of all time
1,The difference one dedicated teacher can make to changing a whole community....
1,I really liked the pilot. It would be nice to know when I can expect to see episode two.
1,"I enjoyed this short movie series very much. I also wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a popular movie series,I believed it would be a nice change .The  name of the movie it self explains the rest. I stumbled across this on Netflix can't wait for next season to come out.<br />Thank you~Robin~"
1,Great characters with excellent story lines.
0,Really poor production and actors.
0,Zoey Deschanel's eyes were the only reason I kept watching past ten minutes. Unimpressed otherwise.
1,Not as good as seasons 1/2
1,"You don't live life at once. you don't live it a week at a time, a month.....It's moments. Pay attention."
1,I love this show even though it is a bit far out it is very interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  (thanks to Stephan King).<br />Greaat show.
1,Very good movie
1,"Classic TV at its finest, morally sound princpals, family friendly, comedy genius, and Andy Griffith. What more could one ask for? Nothing"
1,So many laughs
1,"This movie was so cute. The perfect movie for movie night with my 11 year old son. He enjoyed it and so did I.<br />It's basically a movie about a 15 year old boy who accidentally steals kevin durrants talent and now becomes the star of his high school.<br />Many great lessons on what is important , like friendships  and being humble.<br />A great watch for the whole family."
0,Horrible acting... Very amateurish.
1,Good show.
1,Good stuff!!
0,"It's hollywood, not scriptural...."
0,"This was definitely an interesting movie.  Different in that the story is told by way of videos sent back and forth.  At first I was confused, but then the actors and the story, and the different, interesting subjects they videoed turned out to be captivating. Very Good."
1,"Still one of Christopher Guest's best films.  Both over the top and subtle all at once.  Features some of the top improvisational actors in America today.  If you've ever been involved in community theater, this is a must-see.  Highly recommend seeing it.  Often!"
1,Cheesy but awesome show
1,Great movie! Gives young adults something to think about.
0,I was disappointed in this one.
1,"I enjoyed this, but it was not what I expected from the title.  I assume &#34;Murder&#34; is a quantity not a crime.  I spend the first couple of minute &#34;Saying, what the&#34;. This is a low budget film about the producer's friends and co workers, who are bicycle couriers.  So it is a little slice of life film, I hope the producer finds another venture."
1,Great show!
1,"Smart, well cast , and lots of fun...hooked from the beginning,,,"
1,"Love it! Smart, well-written story lines with well-developed characters."
0,Too slapstickish silly
1,"Mr. Rogers programs are wonderful for all children. Our little grandson loves watching various episodes. As a retired educator of forty-two years, I can highly recommend the programs as an alternative to the violent and meaningless selections offered today. His gentle, kind way of talking with his audience adds such a personal touch. This world needs more people like Mr. Rogers."
1,Kid likes the series I'm kinda meh about it. 1st one was better than the 2nd.
1,Cannot wait for season 3. It is one of the best I have EVER watched .
1,"Science fiction often asks us to examine worlds different from the one we know. It asks 'if then'? What if socialists win elections across the globe? What if Donald Trump wins in 2016, and is such an amazing leader, him and his brand of leadership serve as a guide for our nation, or perhaps the world, for generations to come? Just as often as it asks, 'if then', it asks, 'what if'? What if energy becomes completely free? What if cloning humans becomes as prevalent a trip to the local doctor? Many might recognize Sci Fi in it's creation of imaginary worlds that ask us to look upon our own world right now, presented in a different perspective, sometimes criticizing current society, or instead, some members in it.<br /><br />There were early or proto 'sci-fi' stories written as long ago as 2,000 years ago but it's been said science fiction as we know it didn't really (and couldn't really) exist until the 1900's when we became more aware of the larger world around us. It's a menace, a threat, a disease, or an ideology that threatens us all. After watching Battleship, I can't help but wonder if characters in the story have to save the whole world in order for it to Science fiction.<br /><br />Do the characters in Battleship save the world? With the speed in which aliens send five space ships to Earth after receiving a radio message from Earth, covering at bare minimum 10 light years distance, and their amazing ability to put up an energy shield covering all of Hawaii and a larger portion of ocean, it is a real question as to whether or not they'd send even more ships? The mystery of their other ships disappearance might mean something to them. Perhaps, though, for whatever reason, our navies did save the Earth.<br /><br />There's some question throughout the film whether or not the aliens are truly hostile, or whether they are merely trying to protect themselves and their mission as the film unwinds (although admittedly over reacting to us Earthlings - or did they under react to the threat we pose)?Quite often they let Earthlings go or be on their way if they do not consider them a threat. Are they going to eliminate or subjugate them later? Who knows, but why take any chances? One of the more interesting scenes in the film is shown from the perspective of one of the alien soldiers. It seems to be a memory or a flashback. We see him and his race at war with and being attacked by another alien race.<br /><br />The escalation to war, or at least fighting, is held out to be a metaphor for a fight between an American navy captain (the lead in the film) and his Korean rival. Our navy captain is punished quite severely for participating in the fight. It's an open question in the mind of the viewer through much of the film - is he being punished so hard because his opponent is Korean, or Asian? Throughout the film, especially the later parts, I couldn't help but see pop singer Rihanna, the female lead, in the role of mate to many of the different male characters (especially the extra pale guy with the buzz cut that often behaved kind of stupidly). The 'shells' being loaded and fired became quite interesting. I don't know what it was. It was a very intense movie. We can always hope they achieve contact. Battleship couldn't have been made without an interracial cast. Or at least it wouldn't have been as interesting - having only the action on screen to interest us.<br /><br />Overall it was a very entertaining film. Overall the plot made a lot of sense. Our victory over much more powerful aliens made a bit less sense. There were some breaks in the action, or explanations that went missing in the film (at what point did night fall and the Aliens somehow lose track of them)?  Battleship may have been cut or reduced in length. If so the film suffered a little bit because of it. Over all the film makes more sense if you consider that the aliens might not be completely hostile, or again, if they don't see us as much of an immediate threat to their selfish plans.<br /><br />One thing is certain, never send out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them. There, I just saved the world.nd out a signal to another planet deep in space we know nothing about in order to contact them. There, I just saved the world."
1,Wonderfully put together

1,I liked the series.
1,"Inventive, funny, action packed with well developed characters.  Great to be introduced to new players and see Ron Glass again."
1,The movie was slow moving but the story line wasn't bad. I couldn't tell if it was a western or love story.
1,Good movie
0,"Love his books, he writes interesting characters but this was a huge disappointment. Thought the casting was poor for the most part.  The portrayal of Bosch was unrecognizable from the Bosch I &#34;knew&#34; in the books. But don't give up, Amazon."
0,Interesting concept buy poor acting. Couldn't get into it.
1,My kids love it very very much. I also like to watch it with my kid. it is a great fun for my family to enjoy Shaun the sheep.  We cann't wait to see next season since we have watched many times the seasons in amazon.
1,"Entertaining, crazy ride!"
0,"Too long, poorly written, bad premise, poor acting"
1,Super cute
1,My wife loves this show. She said that it was six stars out of five. I remember watching it briefly as a kid with my mother. I will take their word for it that it is a good show. You should already know if you like this sort of period piece with family values after the first viewing.
0,Sheriff in NM can only serve 2 consecutive 4 year terms then must step down for 1 term.
1,Good movie
1,"awesome, awesome, awesome"
1,"Good thriller no new ground, chscters were ok."
1,"Depending on your sense of humor, this movie may or may not be comical."
1,Why do my wife and I love this so much?
1,"Love this movie! It is one of my favorites, especially if you enjoy watching birds at all. Light-hearted movie with a touch of comedy and some sentimental moments."
1,More amazing musical mayhem from Terrance. Cant wait to see the sequel.
1,"Starts out kinda slow, leaves you kind like WHAT IS GOIN ON. But it gets better."
1,It kept me riveted for a while but there were too many things happening and you will ask yourself why the heck they put in this and that.
0,I though the show was stupid. I only watched episode 1. It was an hour of my life I'll never get back.
1,Why is everyone dogging this movie? It's a great flick and better than most the garbage out there.
1,it's okay
1,I watched this not knowing what I was going to see.  What a powerful film.  The acting was amazing and the situations rang true to life.
1,"Beautifully shot and narrated. This an extreme environment where people are living off the land as they have for generations. The film is satisfying on many levels; the photography, the content, and Herzog's soothing voice. Highly recommended."
1,Loved it â™¡
1,We enjoyed this movie. It's kind of weird but is something different. Acting and effects nicely done!
1,A good story well acted.  I saw it many years ago and still enjoyed it now.
1,A cult favorite for me.  So sad there has not been another sequel.
1,"This movie was awesome. If you like the rock, and you like a great drama/ heart warming story.. This is it.. I loved it"
1,Thanks
1,"It was a good western movie,something that does not come often in this day. The subtitles threw us off in the beginning, but made sense as we progressed through the movie."
1,"A wonderful coming of age story with two young and very talented stars.  My life in HS was nothing like these kids', but the movie helped me see how much I missed by not seeking out folks like them to be my friends."
1,"On the edge of your seat action, with many twists and turns!"
1,Helen Mitten did great job as a Jewish survivor of WWII. It involves a woman in her 80s trying to recover art stolen from her family by the Nazis.<br />I think the acting was well done and I enjoyed the scenes in Austria of the buildings. Good story. True story.<br /><br />The painting &#34;Woman in Gold&#34; is beautiful and intricately done.
1,Very well presented. Good insights into Wells's life & mind. Enjoyed it. Time well spent.
1,Not bad
0,Enjoyable but lesser quality movie for Reese W than usual
1,"She's growing up!  Glad to see her shed the naive, overly trusting girl and become a woman.  Nice twists in this season."
1,"If you like Film Noir you will like The Twilight Zone. Excellent writing, acting and photography"
1,"A delightfully intense movie.  I actually had to pause it for a little it was getting a little too intense for me.  The end left a little to be desired, but the type of ending was typical for a Japanese film."
1,"Funny show for couples to watch together. Left us hanging can't wait to watch next season,"
1,It's pretty good
1,We loved this movie. It played well on our tv.
1,Very fun family movie!!!
1,Took me 3 times to watch the first episode. Not sure why I would start then didn't want to watch. I am glad that I did. It is a great show.
1,Very good action packed
1,Great Show with slick writing and great actors. I will keep watching the show.
0,Disappointing in every way imaginable. :-P
1,Not sexy......I liked  9 1/2 weeks much better
0,Not exceptional.
1,Amazing show
1,The show continues to be irreveren The show continues to be irrelevant you really reverent  smartly written and well acted
1,Loved it.
1,Good escape film.  Hard to her dialog
1,A long time getting to the point.
1,This was a good episode of season 1.
1,I love any Brit series or movies !
1,Bring this Show back please!!!
0,To slow in getting to any action. Hope it gets better soon.
1,Love this movie
1,A powerful and emotional film that everyone needs to see.
1,Good
1,"I loved this pilot. Sure do wish Amazon would produce more of it.  Love the cast, love the subject matter, (hallucinations or miracles?). Different from anything I've seen before!"
1,"I'm not a TV watcher, but I decided to sample this TV series after it was given a glowing recommendation by a respected podcaster.  Because I wanted to understand the background of the characters and story, I decided to start with episode 1, season 1.  For an American TV series, this is exceptional.  Both main and supporting actors are first rate.  The main character, Alicia Florrick, is struggling with some horrendous family problems as she attempts to resume an interrupted law career.  Conflicts between her family life and career serve as a strong theme for the initial season.  Some episodes end in unexpected ways, while some end without a totally satisfying result.  This adds a strong element of realism to the show.  If you're looking for a thought-provoking show that will keep your interest, give this series strong consideration."
1,Amazing show
1,Awesome
1,Great acting by all and well written and directed.
1,Love it.  Have watched it more than once.
1,"Never saw it on TV, however to on to it by friends. Now we can't stop watching. Watching without commercials is the best way to watch."
0,"I fell asleep, so it wasn't that exciting."
1,a differnt type of syfi.
1,Bummed that season 3 isn't on PRIME
1,Interesting plot and somewhat of a surprise story line-----but as far as I am concerned some of the scenes related to sexual aspect could have been left out and still got the point across .
1,It is a pleasure to watch this show in high qualify video. They did a great<br />job in remastering the original.
1,OK but pretty old by todays standards.
1,Best kids show ever
1,"Love this series.  Sorry we didn't discover it sooner, but it's wondrful to watch it on Amazon Prime."
1,Cannot wait for more episodes!!
1,oh ym god
1,It is totally different in some ways. The cursing is over used. Ham acting even with known stars in the film. Guess I would watch a few more episodes to see how God really works thru John (Angel) to change these burned out  hippies or beach bums.
1,Amazing! I could watch it over and over and never get bored of it!
0,SUPER DISAPPOINTED in the final season... What a waste!! THE season made ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE!!
1,Best movie ever I liked it
1,"Good acting, good script, but the ending a little to good to be true."
1,I thought this program was wonderful!
1,Loved It. Reminds me of our family.
1,"Love, love the show."
1,Very good
0,This is basically a tourism video for Belize. The content is actually not bad and is interesting but the narration is not very cool.
1,Classic wholesome TV!
1,"great movie, good acting, based on true story"
0,"This show is utterly ridiculous. Granted, the book upon which it is based has some pretty crazy stuff in it, but the show has gone off the rails and completely misses the point of the book. The novel, by the great Stephen King shares a lot of DNA with the Twilight Zone classic episode &#34;The Monsters are Due on Maple Street.&#34; In both, aliens mess with a slice of pure Americana (a suburban street, a small New England town), but don't really do much. They have an agenda, but they're very hands off in their methods. The point of each is that we don't need to worry about some alien menace. Under the right conditions, we become worse monsters than any extraterrestrial ones.<br /><br />That may have been the focus in the first season, but since then the show has gone into a crazy Invasion of the Body Snatchers Lite direction. It's pretty terrible."
1,Great show that kept me on the edge of my chair!
1,It was strange to see the host phill when he was younger. I love Amazing race.
1,Hilarious!!!
1,Classic
1,A safe middle of road show
1,A happy ending for a dog and a little boy!
1,Better than Seinfeld
1,Best cooking program ever.
1,"I love this show, I'm still sad that it ended."
1,"Great movie. It's a blatant metaphor for the US/Mexican border and immigration issue, which probably accounts for it's less than amazing critic scores. This film has a heavy liberal bias, and I say that as a liberal myself. If you are strongly conservative and unable to separate your politics from your film-going experience, then this may not be your kind of film. If you could watch Avatar and still sympathize with the protagonists I think you'll be okay, but this issue strikes closer to home for some. I found the storytelling to be compelling and enjoyed the film very much."
1,"This show with real talented actors and actresses who have devoted their lives to practicing the craft of acting, is miles ahead of the talentless mindless crap they call reality TV."
1,Holly / Molly she cries to much....
1,Somewhat like Dowton Abby. More shows like this!
1,it was ok. needed more substance.
1,A show before it's time!  The music by Barrington Phelong is perfectly placed along with inspirational story lines.  The normal canned crime show producers need to watch this to know how to deliver a program that is one for the ages.
1,I thought it was a good movie but I think all his movies a great movies.
1,Very cool movie! Almost like a spy thriller more than a superhero movie.
0,"I love Lou Diamond Phillips.  However, I did not love this movie.  There really wasn't much of a plot.  The whole thing could have been shown in 20 minutes flat.  So fill in the time with seduction, sex, sex seduction and sex; and there you have it.  Sorry Lou.  Love you in Longmire."
1,Great and funny show
0,They must have had an envirorist pay for this movie.
1,Great cast
1,Original still holds up well after all these years.
1,Intelligent script and good actors
1,Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Really loved it
1,I thought it was a good movie
1,Pretty Pretty Pretty !!
1,"A very slow start, with a promising ending."
1,Great movie. A fun and kid friendly reminder to get up and move and not be so lazy too.
1,Very good show
1,My grandson LOVES this show!
1,"I had been hearing about this TV show for months and decided to check it out. I am hooked. The story lines are creative, the actors look like they are having a great time and the kitsch factor is a 10. It's an hour of escape every week and it just makes me smile. I think it is one of the smarter comedies on TV with some great writing."
0,"HORRID!<br /><br />I wish I could give this zero stars.  This one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Poor story, poor dialog,poor editing, poor casting, and poor acting..  I can not believe the experienced and well known actors in this movie took on their roles.  Could not even watch it all the way through.<br /><br />The &#34;positive&#34; reviews of this movie must have been associated with the movie and/or studio.<br /><br />Wow, really, really bad."
1,My kind of show
1,The title says it all.
1,Well done
0,"Bad acting, unattractive cast, horrible story line and unrealistic female lead. Women are curvey and flawed, not stick skinny and perfect. Not interested in watching this ever again."
1,Husband & kids love this movie!
1,Love love love this movie. I'm a big fan of the Furious 7 family/crew.
1,Amazing show! Entertaining and learning at the same time. Gotta love it!
0,I thought it couldn't possibly be as bad as people said it was. It was.

1,Great shoot-em-up and pretty people!
1,Very good!
1,"This movie was one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time...maybe ever. It has extended suspense down to an art form, leaving me quivering in my seat. I actually shrieked out loud at one point. Excellent movie and I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good ghost story. You will be impressed...and terrified."
1,Classic!
1,Great story and effects. Kids loved it!
1,"I'm not sure if its the script or the acting, but the quality of the dialogue is poor.  I like the premise of the movie and that is what keeps me watching but I can't help but feel that there was a missed opportunity with this series."
1,"Premise is solid and interesting. Where it lacks is  creativity and cinematography. I wish it had been darker and creepier. They really could have bumped it up a notch by being a bit more detailed and gruesome with the demons. Check out what is supposed to pass for wings. However, I realize this was a small budget horror flick so I enjoyed it for what it's worth."
0,"If it can't be brought, then don't believe the hype. Do your research well before you try to buy. Your only gonna to get hopes up for something that's not attainable."
1,Great movie and storyline
1,O.k.
1,Nail-biting. Love this series....
1,It really shows you how family's should should treat each other
1,Great movie!

1,"OMG! I am a huge fan of the original series, The Walking Dead, and was highly anticipating the newest entry into the Walking Dead universe. It did not disappoint. Even though as an avid fan of the original show and knowing from watching The Walking Dead, that this new series is headed for full scale zombie apocalypse (even though the characters don' know how or what is happening yet), Fear the Walking Dead still managed to create an exciting, nerve-wracking tension, that subtly increased throughout the series premier so that by the end of the first episode I was on the edge of my seat and craving more. Well done, AMC, Robert Kirkman, Gale Ann Herd and the rest of the team behind Fear the Walking Dead. I cannot wait to see where this series is headed!!"
1,It was a super energizing very colorful
1,Historically accurate and we get to see the day to day living of Romans
0,"Weak, no plot, no action, no real monsters...just plain weak"
1,Just amazing!
1,"enjoyed this so much, I've watched it several times."
1,Good story line
1,Funny funny movie...
1,I love 5his show .Too bad they refuse to do it right 9n the big screen . Another Tom Cruise ego trip .
1,Great sci-fi with lots of action Star Trek meets modern-day.
1,"An excellent series, every show is good."
1,Very good movie.
1,just overall great. made me binge.
1,"One of the all time top guy flicks.  Eddie and Nick and a great script.  James Remar is a limited actor, but he does murderous monster very convincingly."
1,True TV trash - for when you are in that mood.
1,If you like action shows this is a good one. If you are offended by nudity or sex by all means stay away from this one! Tends to be a bit over the top on the sex.
1,"well done, straight-up detective show. kind of a throw back to the seventies, like Kojack"
1,Awesome take on a childhood favorite! Loved how each turtle had their own individual & distinct personality that separated themselves from each other.
0,The plot was ok and the main actor didn't seem just like socially shy and cute awkward but more of having a facial distortion problem. In some scenes like at work he seemed to have no problems but around friends he turned into an awkward person. This movie could have been way better.
1,"The Fbi series so far has been informative, but my husband and I turn to each other and say what was the FBI thinking?  In some of the episodes, waiting on the FBI to make a decision on how to handle the case, allows the bad guys (or girls) to get away until the Gmen finally figure out how to capture the fugitives.  Sad."
1,"Fabulous show must see...Even my 10 year old loves Grimm its the only night of the week she begs to stay up and gets her HMWK done quickly so that she can stay up and watch it. We have watched all the seasons thus far, keep bringing it back again and again"
1,Interesting info that you could not see by visiting these places.
1,Superb
1,"Love this show, as does my 4 year old son. Love that it teaches children to &#34;figure it out&#34;"
1,"The best of the Stargate series, in my opinion. It has a cast led by the amazing and well-chose Robert Carlyle, who pulls the rest of the actors up several levels in their performances.<br />The scripts are more adult and more realistic than the average potboiler, too - simple survival requires much intelligence when faced with almost incomprehensible technology and the terrifying hostile environment of deep space. No easy answers. Every scrap of knowledge requires a step into the unknown. And they don't even know where they are in the universe, let alone how to get home.<br />It's a huge, rich canvas for this skilled creative team. So why did it end early? Not because of flaws in the performances or production structure. It was due to SyFy's usual crappy promotion, and so the series ended long before it was out of story-telling potency.<br />Enjoy what's here. Eli is our Everyman."
1,A fun  show.  I wonder where  it will  go next episode
1,My son loves this show!
0,This movie is S***.
1,"this was a good movie. introducing the set to my son, who has seen parts of all of them, but never in their entirety."
1,What's not to love? ;-)
1,great series!!!
1,Good premise - I'm looking forward to more shows
1,Loved it!!! So cute!
1,Great show -  good story line!
1,"Great series, hope there is more"
1,Good doc
1,"Great cast, bittersweet story. It almost felt like a mystery. Martin Landau's performance was impeccable."
1,This is one of my favorite movies!
1,A littlel interesting. Could watch another season or two. Seems to be clean language and scenes witch is a blessing I stead of the trash and violence they show mostly now a days.
1,Greatest series ever they fly by
1,Great movie!
1,I loved it! I need to know what happens next! Giovanni kills it!
1,It's not such a bad. The dialogue could have been better. But the plot was different and interesting.
1,"Wonderful and enchanting fairytale. My husband, I, and our 8 year old granddaughter enjoyed the story very much. It was well written and suspenseful with just the right amount of angst to hold a child's attention without making her sad and ruining the movie for her."
1,Very entertaining
1,It was good.
1,need more episodes. but always love the show.
1,Very entertaining.
1,Memorable!
1,"Couldn't stop watching! Fantastic show, can't wait to see more!"
1,"hello,<br />  a great sci-fi movie.  the plot is unsual, but the story flows smoothly.  the characters are very good.  the guy from mad men plays the rich overbearing father quite well.  sometimes the story gets confused as the characters don't use common sense in protecting each other.  but, as the clock winds down, the story gets better.  what a better place to showcase the future than the old 4th street bridge area... great movie and characters."
1,"I'm not sure how I missed this series to begin with but it is OUTSTANDING.  Funny, quirky and heartwarming all at once. The cast is phenomenal!  Please, please, please renew for Season 3!!!!"
1,Can't believe we missed it when it came out. Great story with good acting and humor sprinkled throughout. We're on season three and it's still interesting and worth watching.
0,Did not like it
1,Can't get enough!
1,"A United Kingdom movie, the accents both vocal and cultural seem to draw the movie out but the ending scenes leave quite an impact and impression on the viewer."
1,Great family movie
1,Well worth the time to watch and enjoy.
1,Love love love this show!!
1,Great series lots of action. Enjoyed it completly!
1,"A great movie - it has great effects, a good plot, reasonable acting, and even some humor.  MUCH better than the likes of Transformers or Battleship."
1,Good show.
1,Great
1,"Wonderful family movie!!  My entire family enjoyed this film, all the way from Grandpa down to our 8 year old grand daughter!"
0,"The subtitles move too fast.  Too much voice-over narration.  Acting is wonderful.  Irony in a drama should be subtle, but in this drama it is in-your-face explosive and never surprises the viewer.  Historically, the flow is well-developed and accurate.  Still, I recommend it for the binge watchers."
1,I just wish someone would create a meme showing Archer quarterbacking for the Seahawks (their backup is RJ Archer). Hilarious show.
1,A lot of action.
1,I LOVE Amazon Prime Instant! Almost as much as the Twilight Zone shows that I watch every night in bed!
0,Suck fest.
1,entertaining. showmanship...touches on contemporary social issues related to his life.
0,"This is an unnecessarily slow movie. Forget the politics of what Edward Snowden did and you still have a movie that fails to keep your attention. There is a lot of subtitle reading that also detracts from any sense of immersion. If you want to know about this story, search the web and save yourself 2 hours."
1,Great show love it
1,Well Done.  Acting terrific.
1,FANTASTIC show!!
1,This has been one of my favorite series.
1,"I highly recommend &#34;A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Happiness: 5 Meditations to Inspire Joy&#34; for novices and experts alike.  Ira offers tools to help those new, as well as those well-versed, in meditation to enhance their practice.  He offers his personal experience, and pulls other amazing stories from those in the community to enhance and inspire each individuals meditation practice in a short period of time."
1,Good
1,Very interesting...there's always a hanger at the end of each episode that keeps you wanting to watch more.
1,"Really FUN Sci Fi experienced from the teenage perspective.  Well done. My teenage daughter, with rather good movie sense loved it!"
1,Read every book.  This show is great!
0,"Slow, boring and hard to follow movie. My husband wanted to stop after 15 minutes but I convinced him to continue as I thought it would get better.  My mistake, would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are looking for something to put you to sleep. :("
1,"My toddler loves this show.  I would, however, like to see more boy's roles featured.  Too much pink and purple."
1,"Definitely an interesting show! If you like a Sci-Fi and the affect of small community pressures on the human mind, then this is a great pick for you. Give it a couple episodes before you decide, but I'm sure before you know it youll be waiting each week for the latest episode!"
1,I like it.  It is something different.  I really have to sit and listen.  I can't be doing something while it's on.
1,Have only watched one episode so far but will continue watching !
1,"I liked this movie better the second time. The first time I was caught off guard by the 1980s music and dancing, in a science fiction space story. It didn't seem to fit together.<br /><br />But this is a movie with a lot of heart. I love sci fi space opera, and also gentle spoofs of space opera like this movie. If you don't take it seriously it's a fun ride."
1,love the show sorry it is no longer on.
1,Awesome movie!
1,scary
1,Love it!
1,"Quite rude, but very funny."
1,"Special effects were great, especially for a TV series. However, I thought Scott Bakula's acting when downhill in the last few episodes."
1,"Oi, it was grand to see two classes meet over ideas about film and to move through that talk to the high numbers. pure quality."
1,"continue with excellent writing, fast paced"
0,"Would not purchase again.  Love these actors normally, terrible plot!"
1,Any film with Jennifer Lawrence in the leading role automatcally gets three stars. Excellent plot development setting up Mockingjay Pt. 2.
1,"For WW1 or general history devotees, a fascinating account of recent excavations of a portion of the Somme battlefield in search of the largest flame thrower ever deployed."
1,Enjoyed this movie. Unwantme2killhim?  Why it happened in my granddaughter school. Amazon prime customer
1,I can't believe it took me this long to watch this show! It is absolutely addicting.
0,Good...not great.
1,Excellent movie
1,Very well done. Intriguing and mesmerizing
0,Every episode is different.
1,"I grew up watching the original B & W TV series on the BBC and loved it - so obviously did a 80's alternative indie band. I first watched this last year on a transatlantic flight from the UK back to the States. Enjoyed it then....loved it even more in the comfort of my own living room. The scenery is spectacular, the story line  is in keeping with the original but compressed for a single film. The performances are endearing and the denouement is quite gripping. Excellent film for the whole family."
0,Needed less misery and more comedy.
1,"I thought it was good, but it ended too quickly."
1,"Wonderful story line, keeps you into the drama, wondering the next move. Well worth the time! It has a low budget feel to it,, but in a way like just as locked stocked and two smoking barrels did. This is one added to the collection of good films to watch."
0,"Very bad movie. The main &#34;bad guy&#34; was well portrayed as a creepy pedophile, but the story was just not that good."
1,Great fun for my four year old.
1,Great show
1,Great Movie.  A nice change from some children's movies that are all action.  It kept my 5 year old daughter entertained through the whole show.
1,Thought it was good entertainment.  Ford plays a good grump and Rachel McAdams does a very good job also..
1,Loved the movie so much in the theater that I purchased the movie on Amazon. Good writing and acting.
1,Classic
1,Shame on BBC for canceling.  I'll never find out about poor Freddie.
0,"Tortuously slow and nonsensical; mention of &#34;Schroeder's Cat&#34; and palaver about other theoretical physics terminology does not amount to &#34;science&#34;. This is silly science-fiction delivered as drawn out melodrama which is simply not entertaining. The minimal amount of weak &#34;special effects&#34; amount to no more that computer screen graphics displays, oscillating lights, fading in & out and vanishing. Whoop-dee-doo. Decent acting and mildly satisfying closure to the feeble premise keep this from getting a 1-star rating."
1,Thumbs up
1,Love it!
1,Great series if you like Sci Fi
1,"I enjoyed this movie.  No, it is not Academy Award material or anything, it is just a fun escapism movie with actors I like.  Dwayne Johnson, Bruce Willis, and others who just fit the movie.  I do not know if it was a money maker but I liked the franchise and if another G.I. Joe is made, I will probably watch that one too.  I like when the good guys win."
1,"One of the best tv series over the past 5 years...can't say enough about the acting, directing and photography....Hope it goes on until RR ends up in Alaska......."
1,"very funny, she's very upfront about everything, rude , crude, quick witted.  refreshing to hear from a female point of view that tells it like it is."
1,OK
1,Aaron Sorkin does his usual good work on this program.  The story line is great but the constant profanity is not necessary.  The acting is very good.
1,Excellent classic
1,"Dense and intense. Did not come together for me for a bit. I may be a dummy but not so much that I didn't think the characterizations believable, the sets authentic looking, the plot dark."
1,"Looks promising, may take time to develop characters."
1,Watching it for the second time.
1,"Great movie!,"
1,"A Great Story but hardly true.  I seriously doubt a person like Escobar would ever allow an American such close access to him even if it supposedly came through a sister.  But the story was entertaining and had the feel of a documentary.  However, as an American myself I recommend that when you watch this keep in mind that Escobar's power and wealth came because of my fellow country men who bought drugs and used them."
1,Good animated show!
1,Great series
1,This series is one of the best that I have seen.  It is never sluggish and tansitions well from one subplot to another.j
1,I love falling skies but very upset that they moved it to TNT. Now I have to wait a year to see this season. And it's not on Netflix!
1,Good movie.
1,Love the humor...can't wait for more.
1,Great movie.
1,"This is a very funny series -- I would give it five stars but for the language. My wife and I can only handle a couple of episodes at a time. I do not consider myself a prude, but the cast's liberal language use is more than I am used to hearing."
1,Excellent show!
1,"Love all the Stargate series, I liked this one and was just starting to feel invested in the characters, too bad it ended after two seasons. Would have liked to have seen more."
1,Mostly slapstick comedy
1,Great concept with nice twists.
1,great movie that you love to watch over & over again..
1,It's just silly and fun!
1,Love this series. Hope it continues!
1,"Great show, exciting plus it had a great balance between the spy activities and personal lives of the characters!"
1,Love this show
1,Excellent
0,"I couldn't hear the actors well, the scenes are too short and too frenetic.  What little I did hear tickled me and the sets are amazing."
1,I have not viewed all the Season episodes but I like what I have viewed.<br />Tom of K. C.<br />Kansas City
1,Love this show.!! So happy it's on amazon prime.!! *:)
1,"Enjoy the series. However, this year they upped the violence and added more sex both of which really weren't needed. I liked some of the new characters McQuad (sp) and the new DI."
1,Enjoyed it
1,"Areally funny, but the vocabulary was  a  bit rUnchy."
1,Love it!
1,"I have enjoyed this series tremendously.  The cast is awesome, personalities as well.  Wish they would come back."
1,Great movie. Terrible ending.
1,Nice twists and turns!  How did I miss this?
1,Overlong.
1,Started slow but ended with breathtaking speed and great chase scenes. Let it run its course and enjoy !
0,Ok
1,Hilarious. You just love to be disgusted by Larry! Secretly you love him of course. His wife is a saint. Oy......
1,"This is a great show! When does it start?? Can't wait. We were disappointed that there was only the one, it left us wanting more!"
1,Every week my Husband and I look forward to Dinner and the latest episode of Extant... I am in love with all of the characters and the story line is so fresh and captivating.
1,"This is a cute, albeit highly improbable, story.  I find that Keira Knightley is always fun to watch, but Sam Rockwell steals the show here.  His quick retorts and verbal banter are the most entertaining aspect of the film.  In some ways, it is similar to his effort in &#34;The Way, Way Back.&#34;  There is nothing groundbreaking here, but it is an enjoyable 100 minutes."
1,Great show and content
1,Great movie! Recommended to us by our daughter's cross country coach as a way to learn the sport! The entire family enjoyed the movie and we learned a lot about cross country!
1,"Typical, predictable, bad acting, poor direction. It is the A Team on steroids. Planes, tanks, trains...you name it. The only thing missing  is the 115 pound ninja that can run 50 miles and kill 20 men over 200 pounds without breaking a sweat. Tank fire with direct hits and everyone unscathed. A must watch movie. Imagine if you had paid to see this thing? I cannot wait until number 4. Like the limbo..&#34;How Low Can You Go&#34;."
1,"Get all seasons, great story lines"
1,"Delightful and poignant film with great performances by all involved.  Always nice to find such marvelous writing in a coming-of-age setting with no violence (except for SPOILER ALERT!!!! the unfortunate duck, which I'm sure wasn't real).  Just great storytelling and sweet moments with good humor."
1,"3 stars mean &#34;it's ok&#34; and that is exactly what this movie is....it's ok. Clearly, it should have been a made for TV movie but regardless, the movie had no real plot and was mostly just character exposition. I did enjoy seeing Mulder and Scully back together again, but the movie should have clearly had a bigger PLOT. I mean, I don't know what the writers were thinking. Why not have something to do with the so-called alien invasion that was supposed to have taken place in 2012? If you're a fan of the X-Files, you should watch it but just note...it's really pretty boring."
1,"Excellent show, loved every minute of it."
1,Kids love it
1,Love &#34;The Expendables&#34; movies. Classic old school action flix with a modern touch.
1,Good movie
1,It certainly held my interest. Had to watch several episodes in a row because I couldn't stop watching.
1,Awesome
1,Great show.
1,This is really a sweet story that has a happy ending.  It is for all men that are really shy.
1,A movie not to be missed!
1,"Great picture, cast and  story line."
1,"Entertaining, well done, but it is hard to end such movies in a satisfying realistic way."
1,The machinations of the court were interesting to follow.  I had not realized how many chance maneuvers had to fall into place for Henry VIII to rule a century later.  Well done all around.
1,Very entertaining!
1,It's funny and entertaining.  Recommend to all.
1,"Was hoping to see Emily Ratajkowski's knockers, disappointed that I didn't. Other than that it was aces."
1,One of his best.
1,Interesting and entertaining if you enjoy documentaries!
1,Beautiful!
1,meh
1,"Fairly predictable, but well acted movie.  Clint Eastwood's son has grown into a competent actor!"
1,Great show
1,Season 2 has always been my favorite .
1,Our 3 and 5 year old enjoy this show
0,The &#34;story&#34; is incomprehensible.  The entire movie is so badly cast that it's often laughable.  Don't pay for this.
1,"This is a fantastic series that's. More science-oriented and less soap-operaesque than DS9, which was so poorly done in the first 3 seasons that we skipped to season 4 and still found plenty of stupid episodes. Not so with Voyager. Janeway is the best of all the captains, even Picard, and I don't say that lightly."
1,"A pretty good movie but kind of far fetched but again who knows maybe this time is coming before long ,all in all it kept me interested,but it's really not my type of movie"
1,"Whether its the living nightmare babycakes creates for his father or the rat dick students at the university, this is always entertaining"
1,Easy to watch.  Believable and well acted.  Just a  great way to spend some time.
1,Great Eastwood movie
1,just enjoying it
1,love it love both actor  watched it 3 times
1,loved it
1,best show ever
1,there are many films which try to capture the inner life of the young as they try to come to an understanding of the world adulthood and their place in it - this is one of the very best - like a totally internalized 400 Blows - all the pangs of want and beauty and passion and uncertainty - all the<br />transitory fleeting moments - like the ocean she loves - a wonderful film - and a wonderful performance by Moriah Bloona - a must see...
1,"Rusty (Ed Helms) is grown and an airline pilot for a small airway. When the neighbors are over for dinner, he sees an enormous amount of father-son bonding, that he become envious and realizes his family is in a rut. He decides a vacation to Wally World (and not Paris) is what the family needs and announces to the audience &#34;The new vacation will stand on its own.&#34;<br /><br />His family is a bit dysfunctional.  We discover his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) was known as &#34;Debbie do anything&#34; in college. As a side note, I don't believe there is a Memphis State University, but the University of Memphis is a dry campus. Kevin (Steele Stebbins) the younger son swears excessively, wrestles, and likes to bully his older brother James. James (Skyler Gisondo) who &#34;doesn't have a vag.., but it would be okay if he did&#34;, keeps a wish diary.<br /><br />The film was funny. The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.<br /><br />Guide:  Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity."
1,"Very exciting, kept my interest up.  Not too happy with the way the series ended."
1,Loved it. Recommended by a friend. Had to see the whole Season 1 last week. Getting Season 2 from Netflix.
1,So funny.
1,Wow. Powerful
1,"Worth the watch, though it comes to an abrupt ending which I can forgive because it was a happy ending."
1,His eyebrows are wonderful
1,Great show. Looking forward to more seasonal!!
1,real great show all around  can not wait for  prime to get season 2 till then will be watching reruns.
1,We love the show!
1,I loved the series.  I had read all the Bosch books and truly enjoyed the shows.
1,Hilarious! Especially if you like inappropriate humor/things.
1,Saw it 4 times!
1,"I love this show. Every season was good. 1&2 were artistically divine from direction to production, then I was ever amazed by the acting. I must say I didn't like how the focus shifted from Hannibal to Will, then Dolarhide in season 3. Other than that, the writing was well done and Mads Mikkelsen was born to play Hannibal. I've been a Hannibal fan since the Silence of The Lambs and he's about as good as Anthony Hopkins if not, dare I say better. With the same writers from season 1&2, I really hope someone picks this show up. I'd hate to see it finished so soon."
1,In a word ... Brilliant!!!
1,Great
1,"It wasn't quite up there on the same level with Pride & Prejudice, but this was a really good film.  The characters were really well portrayed by wonderful actor."
1,My boy loves this show.when whenever i put it on he runs around singing the song.
1,Awesome as ever !!!!
1,Let me start by saying that I am a fan of True Blood and I have read most of the &#34;Sookie Stackhouse&#34; novels.  I was anxiously waiting for Season 5 to become available and I was more than a little disappointed.  The plot seemed to take a bizarre turn with Bill & Erik and the Vampire Authority worshipping &#34;Lilith&#34; who was the &#34;orignal vampire.&#34;  This season seemed to focus less on Sookie's adventures and more on the Vampire League.  Alcide and the werewolves and the fairies were thrown in here and there but I missed Sookie!  It seemed as though too many things were going on at once and nothing was resolved.
1,Great story
1,Great show
1,HA HA. I remember seeing this in the movie theater.  It is good old fun.
1,"Love the music, acting and story line. Great show and totally hooked!"
1,"A good series, volume 11 from NOVA. I'm a science fan and rarely am disappointed with NOVA's coverage of the latest popular (and not-so-popular) science."
1,I love the Golden Girls.
0,Stupid movie.
1,Really interesting story
1,"Even though we're late to the party, it's fun catching up! We're looking forward to season II."
1,Ok Neapolitan dynamite knock off
0,"Loving the first movie, Divergent, I was super excited when the second one came out, Insurgent, I was super excited and read most of the second book prior to (although I didn't see it in the theater, I ran out of time) the second it came out, I RedBox'd it and after the first 30 minutes I was SOOOOO glad I had not wasted my money in the theater or bought it. The movie took out the most important parts skipping through what I thought was the whole reason behind the book which was to show how that certain faction was able to maintain its hippy type of go with the flow earthy behavior was because they were being drugged the whole time through the special tea ...... this came to light only after Tris was given the same tea and not being used to it, it had a over drugging loopy effect in her. The movie cut this whole section out and really ruined the whole movie."
1,He is very funny.
1,Loved it.  Great movie!
1,Fantastic
1,Great show!
1,Probably the best performed and written saga this century
1,"Nice movie about two gay brothers who have taken different paths in life and how they have come back together after years apart. Johnny Hazzard plays one brother who is outspoken, a major flirt, and a party type guy who does what he wants when he wants and to whomever. He is easy on the eyes and makes no bones about his sexuality. Mark Strano plays the other brother he is a homebody who has stayed in the family home and continued to run the family business. He is not the social butterfly, more protected and straight acting.  The two brothers find themselves back together as the fancy free brother is broke and homeless and needs somewhere to land and the more put together brother needs to open up himself more and be true to who he is.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully made movie about family and friendship, love and longing and the ghosts from the past. An an actor Johnny Hazzard has improved so much from his past roles in cheesy porn like soap operas such as The Lair, and knew to me at least Mark Strano could not have played a better character that many people can identify with.<br />Highly recommend this movie."
1,Love it
1,Cant wait for sequel
1,Documentary that was slow and too much of a documentary. I was hoping it would have more of the examples of Jewish humor.
1,I love this series.  The characters are done really well.  I find myself laughing out loud.
1,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! looks are not everything!!!
1,Better than i expected
1,"Good clean movie , without filth or filthy language"
1,totally absorbing and gut-wrenching. no walk in the park but worth it.
1,"This is a wonderful show, wish it had gone on for more than three seasons! But if bad language and the sight of naked bodies bothers you, you may want to watch something else."
1,"This is a good series, although the thought of people still living this life is a scary one."
1,"The director is really talented, and gets a great performance out of his actors."
1,"Hilarious show. If you want the humor of Seinfeld, but more extreme you'll love this show. You can tell LD wrote Seinfeld and wasb allowed more creative freedom with HBO."
1,Complex Good Cast
1,"Woody is the best, then Carla, then Sam, then Norm, Frasier, Rebecca is on the bottom of the list with ole Cliffy!  Rebecca is actually on the bottom of Cliffy's shoe when he walks his postal route.  She is the one I love to hate but It's hard to decide who is worse, Diane or Rebecca!?  Rebecca is the same story over and over, a magnet to wealthy men who don't notice her even though she's obviously a sexy floozy.  Carla is the only woman in the show that I would ever hang out with."
1,"Very funny movie. One of those goofball, SNL kind of movies."
1,Loved the movie.  Not a classic but good all around for enjoyable viewing experience.
1,scary
1,Love the stories!
0,"Unless you read the synopsis, you're going to have NO idea what is going on until 20 minutes before the ending of the movie (which is a crap ending)."
1,Breaking. Bad. Do I need to say anything else?
1,Love these Character.  My grandson starting watching them at 3 year and<br />still loves them at almost 6.  Wish they'd keep filming.
1,I love this show! I can not wait for the next season. Great writing and acting.
1,The writing and characters are superb!
1,"Without Charlize, this would probably be a second rate thriller... she makes it totally involving."
0,Seems kinds of boring and not much mentoring done. Some products silly few that were of value.
1,Good movie!
1,"Exceptional, Smart, Funny."
1,HD resolution could have been better.
1,Love
1,It was ok. I expected something morÃ© interesting  about Nero. More history.
1,"I hate to say it, but I like it more than Downton Abbey"
1,Good storylines and action...but comical sex kills the last star!
1,My favorite!!
1,This is a classic show!  Very enjoyable
1,Pretty good
1,Very Entertaining.
1,Excellent programs.
1,Our kids loved this show and were disappointed that there are not more episodes available. We are hoping for more episodes in the near future !
1,"This a fantastic new show. The writers strike the perfect balance between the believable fears and fantasies of our childhood years and the wonders of growing up. They were smart in not trying to make this story about special effects or action, but about characters, stories, and lessons on youth. My eleven year old daughter and I made this one of our most favorite before bedtime things this summer. We truly hope there will be a next season."
1,that was a great film it made me cry
1,Hilarious!!
1,"I am a fan of books by Michael Connelly and looked forward to viewing Bosch, although with some trepidation because these kinds of translations from books to the screen so frequently are a disappointment. Over the course of the first season, I became a fan of the show as well. It is an accurate rendering of the Bosch novels and generally is excellent in every respect, e.g., acting, directing, production values, and terrific music that reflects the tastes of Bosch as depicted in the books. Kudos to Amazon!"
1,what the heck happened to the story of Noah. only watched it because of Russell  Crowe
1,Wonderful!
1,A very clean and inspiring movie that the whole family could enjoy. Such a moving film about a father's love!
1,Fine and entertaining series.
1,I enjoyed every episode and will watch again.
1,"It was good, some advertisement but still a good one to watch."
1,I love Andy Griffith show
1,"The tone of this movie leaves one longing for times like these. Little women tells a sweet tale of friendship, sistership, and love. It has a certain completeness in it as well...going on from younger years and ends a little later after all of the little women have grown."
0,Interesting series but getting a bit dated now. Forensic advances have almost made this program obsolete!
1,Awesome
1,Larry David will crack you up every time.
1,"Pretty well filmed and acted.  A little slow and stilted at times.  Perhaps too much of the &#34;boys at home&#34; story for me.  I was more interested in the strategies that resulted in victory, and the backstory on how decisions were made.  This hopped from island to island to island and really did not show how victories were decisively won and the human cost of those victories on both sides. It also lacked any story line around how and why the troops moved from place to place.  They just got back on the ship and went to a new island-end of story."
1,"Non stop action from Episode One, season 1 all the way thru Second Season, maybe a little violent for young viewers..just wish 3rd season was also now streaming, just have to wait for that release"
1,Vintage Sorkin.
1,My Bueno
1,Very good series
1,A beautifully filmed movie/documentary. Makes me want to go back!
1,What a creative team to put this show together!
1,great
1,Good acting and subject matter.
1,Loved this movie â¤ï¸
1,"One little boy's love for his father transmutes into what he believes to be magical powers that can save him during WWII. After seeing his favorite matinee hero perform in their town he is convinced that he has the ability to bring his father home. Their priest, on the other hand, instructs Little Boy to perform a series of tasks instead. A sweet and funny tale that isn't overtly Christian but can be enjoyed by people of all faiths. Amazing performances by an amazing cast!"
1,"If you are looking for mindless fun, this is a great place to get it. The story doesn't matter (which is a good thing for this movie) also the romance is very weak but if you want fast cars and senseless dialogue this movie is sure to be a hit."
1,Need more episodes!
1,Clean entertainment. Lighthearted detective work.
1,Kids love it
1,Oh the twists and turns....jjust when you have it figured out the writers throw you a curveball...we are disappointed they could not plot it out for another season.
1,interesting and comical
0,"Horrible story , super predictable. Don't waste your time or money . Anyone with a laptop could throw this together In 20 min"
1,"Excellent movie! There should be more more movies like this out there, and in the name of God there will be! Amazing. Definitely a watch over and over again movie! If you are a true Christian you will love this movie! Excellent! If I could give it 10 stars I would!"
1,"â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘GREAT CRIME CHASE MOVIEâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘<br /><br />This is just 2 hours of solid entertainment. Clint Eastwood plays a Secret Service agent who was guarding JFK in Dallas the day he was shot in 1963. He didn't take a bullet for the President. It's haunted his career and his life ever since.<br /><br />Fast forward 30 years and he gets sucked back into a Presidential protection detail when a rouge assassin (John Malkovich) goes insane and threatens the current president. It's all a game to Malkovich, who just wants to see if he's good enough. And he lures Eastwood into the game because he wants to go against the best.<br /><br />It's a cat and mouse game with high stakes.<br /><br />The acting is good.<br /><br />The story is great.<br /><br />It's just a good way to spend 2 hours."
1,It was just fun to go back in time when there was good tv programs without the swearing
1,"This is such a good movie. It has always been a favorite of mine. Matt Dillon was so hot! I always wished I could have been that girl he loved so much! I was very young when the movie came out, and I must have seen it at least a hundred times!"
1,"After watching the first two seasons, I didn't think this intense drama could get any better, fortunately I was dead wrong. It just keeps getting better. The characters are so well drawn, and the tension between them is something to experience. Totally hooked!"
1,Interesting premise with lots of possibilities for development.  Looking forward to future episodes to see where writers take the story.
1,Excellent show. Looking forward to the next season.
1,Awesome movie but I hate it the main character
0,Worst. Don't do it.
0,Mudane
1,Loved this show. Was terribly sad when it ended even though I knew how/when it ended...
1,"It's a good movie, but kind of hard for patriotic Americans to watch."
1,"very unique story, creative characters, well acted"
1,Good to see Kim Possible again.  But it would be great to get the series.
1,Yayyyyy
0,I can't invent any reason why this movie was ever shot. Makes no sense to me.
1,"Great movie, love love the narrator"
1,A great old classic movie. Loved the acting and the story line.
1,This is history on steroids!  It doesn't get any better!
1,Super show
1,Excellent show
1,SOOO good
1,A little slow going but I love this show
1,The BEST kids show ever.
1,I loved it.  The two main characters are wonderful. His parents are great also.
1,Hilarious...more eps please!
1,classic movie
1,I loved this! So disappointed that it will be months before I can watch another episode!
1,Really enjoyed it. Too bad I didn't find it earlier.
0,Not worth watching...strange movie<br />Robin Williams great as as always
1,excellent
1,"Great Show I hope this is at least a 2 season show..Great plot, awesome actors, an dying to see the next episode!"
1,very good movie
1,It was good but I think it could have been better
1,If you love the National Parks you will love this.
1,Hilarious...you'll laugh from start to finish.
1,I really enjoyed this movie!
1,"We love the simple, fun ideas that this show gives us. Highly recommend!"
1,This is a very captivating series and great acting.
1,Great thriller...
1,"Very well done,  excellent choice on casting, and it follows the book beautifully!"
1,"The heroine is smart, courageous, beautiful, and good.  The fact that she fell madly in love with some guy over summer vacation, and that she hasn't gotten over him, and that the CIA would put someone so green in the positions she faces, without a gun no less, seems silly, but I got over that fast as it is an exciting show."
1,"Good story of the war against British rule. People die because they were in the way, and not because they were an enemy."
1,very good movie - a bit overdone - but good action
1,Pretty good
1,"It's not exactly a &#34;happy show&#34;, but I think this is some of the best writing, directing, and acting of the decade.  Incredibly creative story telling."
0,Boring
0,"Not too bad...for a mediocre high school play. They started with a fairly decent story line, but &#34;lost it&#34; through poor (very) acting and writing attempts at being clever or cute. Disappointed."
0,Nope.
1,"Really good.  Pay attention and don't start if you don't have time to watch the whole season.  It moves!  Stanley Tucci is awesome.  I would say more but don't want to give anything away.  The very end was predictable but it was not disappointing.  Although I figured out the end, I couldn't see how it would get there. Once it did, I realized I would never have.  So simple I missed it."
1,"I wish they were continuing this series from a selfish perspective! I loved these books, and loved this series. So happy I was finally able to watch it on Prime!"
1,just purchase this and I just cant get enough of the Templars zombies it creepy to watch them move so slowly however they do manage to get their target every single time!!! more more please!!!!!
1,This really brings me back to the 80s!!
1,"I wanted to like it more, especially since it was Hoffman's last film. Still, the bloodcurdling scream of impotent rage he emits at the end will stay with me as long as I live."
1,Have not figured out how to get but I'm sure I will soon lol
1,Hilarious!
1,"FOX, HANK, SAMPSON....WHO CARES DAVIDS GOT IT"
1,"Awesome, action filled ride.  Great guy kind of stuff with turns every episode."
1,One of the all time greats.  How could someone make nuclear holocaust funny?  Only this bunch
0,Slow Trying to be too &#34;Artsy&#34;
1,A decent movie. Some violence but takes a back seat until the end of the movie. It's about a family facing trials individually and together to finally realize what they mean to each other. The story is some times prompted along by family friends. Worth a look.
1,Pretty fun series so far.
0,Simply cannot get into it. Tried a few episodes and haven't found it to be entertaining despite good actors.
1,"Fantastic, don't miss a single episode!!!"
1,Very realistic and enjoyed the story overall.
1,Awesome movie for the whole family :)
1,A-MA-ZING!
1,"Season One was great!  LOVED IT!  Can watch with the whole family.<br />Season Two: Who wants to watch bathroom foreplay with their teenagers and preteens?  Get back to some good old Michael Bay story telling with plenty of explosions, and leave the tawdry stuff to ABC Family."
1,I loved this show the first time around and it's still great.
1,I was hooked after the first episode and had to binge watch the entire season.
1,love this series.
1,Great! Learning about animals is good for my grandchildren.
1,My nephew believes this is the greatest program--3 years old.  It is a spinoff of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood which was also a great program for children.
1,"Wonderful, feel good movie.  I loved it"
1,One of the funniest films our species has ever produced
1,Like it as much as seasons 1-3
0,Did not like it at all. Camera work made me dizzy. Not interested in story.
1,Great movie!
0,"Terrible song choices, but I'm guessing.  I didn't make it thru the second dismal song.  Brown just hoots, hollers, and says Alright for 3.5 minutes.  Where are the lyrics? Just not my kind of music I guess.  I used to like him when I was younger, learning the drums.  But now, I care about lyrics which he has none."
1,Wonderful series.  Sorry it comes to an end.
1,"Fun to watch, but you must give up a sense of reality."
1,Great stories about real past events
1,"I love hospital shows, always have."
1,It definitely gives a new spin to vampire genre!
1,Great story and fine acting.
1,"I thought Wesley Snipes did not do a good job.  He joked around much to much.  Other than that, I enjoyed the movie."
1,"From lighthearted CIA rookie to sometimes very dark CIA phyco-spy, great stories, great supporting cast.  Generally a fun series to watch."
0,"Ugh. Barely yet somehow able to keep my interest, but ultimately a dud. Decent acting in a few scenes, primarily from Juno Temple and Michael Cera (and I do mean only a few scenes). And I may have missed something...but the title does not seem to have anything to do with the anything in this movie (not that a title has too and not that I was looking for David Copperfield). Skip this movie."
1,Quite a good movie I thought.
1,Pretty good. Decent characters. Decent acting.
1,super job
1,"Wow! What a great series. Easy to follow for those of us who are not U.S., history buffs.  Sets, actors, locations were all amazing, and the audio is fantastic. Have watched it two times so far."
1,Show the entire family can watch.
1,Very uplifting movie.
1,Fun
1,"Such a lovely movie.  Slow paced, visually beautiful, haunting soundtrack, good character development.  Stanley Tucci and Alan Rickman are both awesome additions to the cast. Saw it twice in the theater and now happy to own an HD digital copy (which streamed great.)."
1,Very well crafted story that keeps one engaged.
1,My kids love love love this show!
1,Its is a really good movie. The ending is extremely sad.
1,Brings back a lot of good memories
1,The ext version topped it all off.
1,"Funny, intelligent script. Fresh and unpredictable."
1,"Great ensemble, terrific hard boiled stories."
1,Hilarious! One of my favorites from FX.
1,my son 5y is a big fan ;)
1,"Honestly, I don't know if it does.  What I do know is that I don't feel like I'm using all 8 pounds of mine.  Well Lucy can and it is pretty cool."
1,"Good show, lots of familiar faces, too bad it only lasted one season.  Love Kim Delaney & Tom Everett Scott :D"
1,Si sad it's over was a great show!
1,Pretty predictable...pretty bloody.
1,"Ridiculous plot.  Overacted in various parts.  Not to be taken seriously and does no service to the sic-fi genre.  Ann Hathaway and Matt Damon as credible astro scientists? Mcconaughey delivers a decent performance.  Lithgow, C. Affleck, Burstyn gave best supporting roles.  The movie was more of an attempt to tug at the heart strings, which did deliver a cliche but moving scene with old Murph and her dad. The movie is way too long to sit through just to see some guy end up behind a library...ridiculous."
1,I loved it because it was a family movie
1,It was pretty good. A chick flick
1,The first couple of seasons started out really good but then it just got worse and worse with every season.
1,Love this show!
1,Interesting concept; curious where the series will go and how long they can support the conceit.
1,Taking an odd twist but still enjoyable fantasy TV.
1,The books are so much better than the movie but books always are. I would definitely recommend reading the books. They are amazing.
1,Great movie with great cast. Love Tim Allen. His  movie &#34;For Richer or for Poorer&#34; with Kristey Alley (and &#34;Newman&#34; from Seinfeld) is my favorite film.
1,"After more than 10 years I *finally* saw this movie. Oh man, it's awesome! I loved every second of it!!! Great for adults and children at the same time; maybe even more so for the adults. (But still incredibly perfect for kids)."
0,"It was a total waste of time, mostly due to amateur editing. Seems like they ran out of film and just decided to call it the end."
0,Really bad writing! So frustrating because the actors are amazing talents and the story is even such a great idea! But the writing was terrible
1,Excellent
0,Could have cut 15 minutes of it when she was in coma.
1,"Another great movie that I'd never heard of! Amazing how many good pieces of work there are that get little or no promotion. This one wasn't as sophisticated in production as some, but a good story -and well done."
1,The funniest show I've seen in awhile.  The chemistry that these two writer/actors has is great.  Season 2 can't get here quick enough.
0,"This movie started out very well and had many laughs.  It slowly began to have far too many subplots going on with the various characters and made it somewhat difficult to follow.  Too much silliness (not humor) and too much of the young man and girl friend/fiancee.  The end was far too long with the elaborate wedding, etc.  As always, Judy Dench and Maggi Smith were wonderful.  The First Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was excellent.  This one was a dud."
1,Good movie - great ending
1,Great show! Got to Love the character Rylan.
1,Gripping series
1,Very cute
1,I loved the way this season started.  It kept the intrigue going to the very end of the season.  I can't wait for Season 3.
1,ok
1,"It's really quite dated in the realm of today's Science Fiction, including current Star Trek offerings."
1,I like it.  They could have left out the nudity.. it doesn't really add anything.
0,A little too wierd for my tastes
1,Wonderful film on a difficult topic
0,"too slow, violence  was there at times, but pace of the movie was slow."
1,Moved a bit slow.
1,Classic story of how all of those Irish fields surrounded by rock walls got there.  The villain is the American-Irish son of the land owner.  There are plaques in Ireland where this movie was filmed.  Netflix doesn't have this great Richard Harris movie.
1,Good show!
1,Love Justified got better and better each season
1,Great TV show.  Story lines are a bit predictable though
1,"These work great on the computer, not as nice an interface on the TV"
1,Awesome!
1,"Love it like all the others, can't wait for Season 6 on Amazon."
1,"Great series all around. The characters were well developed, and some of the main female characters very sexy and fun to watch in their escapades."
1,great
0,Pretty far fetched
0,"It's pretty low production values but does have some good information. However, it failed to keep my attention. I tuned out after 20 minutes."
1,Loved it
1,We are enjoying this series very much!
1,"watched this when i was 5 years old, the shame on them for ever creating a kid's cartoon that makes even adults cry at this movie, the music is a masterpiece all on it's own which is what makes this movie a kid's masterpiece, you just don't see this kind of quality in movies like this anymore, one of the original legends"
1,"A selfish, self-serving doctor learns what is really important in life with the help of a dedicated firefighter."
1,Very well written
1,Great show.  Must see tv....
1,"Was a cute story, had some funny parts."
1,Can't stop watching it
0,It's an ok comedy. Well worth the rental.
1,"Late to the game, totally stumbled upon this on Prime without any idea about this series.  The writing is so smart, irreverent, and sarcastic.  The acting is really, really good.  I was immediately hooked, watched all 6 of the Season 1 episodes in one session.  I cannot wait for Season 2."
0,Really lame
1,Great movie
1,It is a good show.  Sometimes too many twists to the storyline.
0,Terrible.  Michael Bay movies are the worst.
1,Such a great show that keeps u wanting more!
1,Only watching season 2 but really enjoying it.
1,Good clean fun
0,too predictable..was not nearly as well written as the first season
1,Very enjoyable!
1,Adult language and situations and resulting humor.  Displays the painful growth of a player into a real human.
1,"Cute, but not superb.<br /><br />He was kind of likable."
1,Great heartfelt movie with great story.
1,Great movie! Can't wait to watch the others!
1,Getting more evilicious each season!
0,Don't waist you time.
1,Enjoyed the whole show. Great storyline and composition.
1,Great movie I enjoyed it very much.
1,"Very entertaining,well done"
0,Gritty
1,"Once again, production qualities a nd acting put the show at the top in spite of increasingly soap opera character to the writing."
1,I really like this show. I love the family dinners. I love the entire family thing! Can't wait to catch the next season. Good show. Something nice for a change.
1,Well done.  Story line comes full circle.
1,Great!
1,Great show!!!
0,The plot was meandering and creepy. Even good actors couldn't help with that.
1,Absolutely love this show! Thank you for the wonderful story and the amazing music!
1,Very engaging for my 6 almost 7 year old!

0,Couldn't even get through first 5 minutes
1,Heartfelt
1,This is a wonderful program for kids and adults.  I found it educational for my grandchildren and informative for me as an adult.  It was so nice to view something that had no violence and yet so entertaining for my grandchildren who are 3 and 6.  Please make available for viewing more often.<br />I give you a thumbs up for bringing this type of programming to those of us who live with our Kindle products everyday.
0,No story line.  Just a bunch of vulgarity to keep people watching.
1,"This is simply a top-of-the-line show. I'm watching each episode of season 1 a second time before moving on to subsequent seasons. I'm savoring and want the experience to last--and I don't want to miss a moment, an inflection, or an innuendo. The dialog is over the top, fast-paced, hilarious, piercing, clever. Difficult to believe it can be so good. Characters are intricate and relationships jaw-dropping. I can't say enough about the series. I consider watching it an absolute treat, which is rare these days."
1,My whole family loved it.
0,Stupid
1,"Fabulous for my kiddos. I love the simplicity and how every episode has a specific value or morale that it teaches. Both my children, 4 and 5 love it."
1,Fringe is the best syfy series I've ever seen.  It is sad to see it end.
1,Like this show.
1,very interesting ...
1,Smart and funny show. Can't wait for it to return.
1,Wonderful show!!!!  Keeps your full attention all the way through each episode!!!
1,"Five stars is not enough. Ali was the greatest both inside and outside of the ring. All Americans, and anyone anywhere that hold that freedom and human rights must be universal, should see this video. Ali was a moral giant with a stalwart internalized sense of right and wrong. He would not, and did not, bow down to a racist establishment power structure that offered odds vastly against him sustaining himself if he stood against it. He was willing to risk all of the fame and fortune that he had miraculously achieved, to suffer being barred from his profession forever if necessary, and even to go to jail. He intended to follow his spiritual/moral core beliefs no matter what. He did so and he paid dearly. He lost what many believed might have been his best 3 years in the ring when he was barred from fighting for that period of time, he had difficulty in making a living, he drew chagrin for being a black Muslim...but, when the smoke cleared he came off of the ropes victorious. This story is a salute to the human spirit of a true champion of the human race and I'm not referring to his superb boxing. His courage and dedication was an inspiration and to the benefit of<br />humanity. He was, and will remain, a true hero. Everyone should see this video. It should be mandatory in schools."
1,Fun
1,Interesting story lines
1,Strong documentation of the importance of spirituality and healing that can be experienced simply by presence to the profound places of grace.
1,I love this show! Hilarious!
1,Great
1,Very good series
1,"Entourage is an amazing show! I watched it here and there when it first aired on HBO and I always really enjoyed it. Now with the new movie and it being available on Amazon Prime we have been making a habit of watching it every night! The show has everything. Great acting, great story lines, great sets and scenes that are enjoyable to view. Every episode is something new and different and best of all hilarious. I'd recommend the show to anyone. I love it."
1,Love this show! It's best if one knows a little Tudor history.  I use Closed captions so I don't miss a word.
1,Good
1,As good as SG-1. Definitely a good binge watch
1,Great Documentary!
1,Best show ever
1,Ever see someone on the street and think &#34;I wonder how they got like that?&#34; Each of the stories these men tell of their lives answers that question.
1,good movie
1,Engaging with lots of twists and turns.  A bit on the bloody side and certainly not for the squirmish.
1,Good French movie about a young man and his relationship with his father.
1,"Wife and I split on this one. She would have given it four stars and I would have given it one. She felt that Charlize really pulled this out and I felt her effort was squandered. To me, a real waste of a great cast with uneven screenplay and lethargic direction. This could have been so much better."
1,IF you like action films this is a film for you!!!
1,My toddler grandson loves to watch the Bubble Guppies when he's at grandma's house.  Wish season 2 was free with prime.
1,Original and exciting. The acting is great.
1,Very informative and interesting.
0,"Entertaining enough, but it tries to be The Celluloid Closet and it isn't by a long shot.  If The Celluloid Closet isn't available on Amazon Prime then give it a try."
1,TURN: Washington's Spies gives an historical perspective towards events of the Revolutionary War. This is an incredibly entertaining series that I can not stop watching. AMC has managed to (rather accurately) portray the actions of the Culper Ring in a thrilling way that can appeal to just about anyone.
1,Picks up where the TV show left off... I am a fan of the show...loved the movie.. Piven need an Oscar...I hope for more.
1,Not what I expected.
1,Cannot wait for the next season! Awesome show!
1,Not as good as the first two seasons.  The plot is all over the place.
1,Very enjoyable movie.
1,"Great show, great season finale"
1,love the awkward and unlikely situations in this show.
1,Great plot great characters!  Love every moment
0,"The show itself is amazing - the lights, costumes, dancing, all over-the-top.  Unfortunately the singing performance isn't very strong.  We only watched the first few songs then turned it off."
1,Great story. Award performances.
1,"Great movie.  A must watch.  I was kind of hesitant because I feel that WWII European Western Front war movies are a dime a dozen, but this was a very emotional story.  Felt real and accurate in the military members portrayals."
1,Terrific movie one of the best
1,3 year old son thinks it's &#34;Awesome!&#34;
1,This movie is dope\m/
1,Terrific acting!
0,Sort of a silly premise for a show.  I didn't make it past the first episode.
1,Excellent
1,I have loved this movie since I was a young girl coming of age. It used to come on tv a lot when I was young and it has faded into the shadows. I don't know why it hasn't gotten more recognition (enough to be released on DVD!) Great coming of age story.
0,Would not recommend for the price
1,This movie was an unexpected pleasure!  T
1,Well done! This is a powerful movie.
1,very GOOD show
1,"A heart-wrenching story of love and loyalty, certainly in this case the best and original Lassie story. This is the real deal."
1,Great movie
1,Simply the most talented actress in the game working with an incredibly gifted crew and actors!
1,Very insightful!
1,Very good
1,One of the best series ever!
1,love it
0,"First 5 minutes contains a very explicit sex scene. The show might be great, but I shut it off and will never know. Should have been TV-MA, IMHO."
1,Great movie. Full of suspense.
0,Semi-interesting movie but the abrupt ending or lack of an ending period made it awful.
1,"I have been to Iona, and I think this gives a very accurate and fair description of what a trip/pilgrimage there is like.  It's hard to capture what a wonderful place this is and how you feel when you are there, but this does a fine job for the time and resources allotted."
1,Best of the Next Generation cast movies.
1,Arie is the best!
1,Excellent...well acted. Many unexpected twists keeps it even more exciting!
1,Excellent show.
0,While not a bad story it moved too slow.
1,Love it! Can't wait for the next series!
1,Best tv for children...& Adults enjoy it too with great artists and composers appearing on show.<br />Like Yo Yo Ma
1,Enjoyed
1,What an incredible story.  Loved it!
1,"A truly great series, come on season 6."
0,The ending was the only good part to this first episode.
1,Grandson loves it
1,I cried like a baby. Thanks alot.  Loved it though.
1,Just okay
1,"Wonderful story, so well acted and worthwhile watching."
1,It took me about 10 minutes to buy into Titus Welliver as Harry Bosch. Only because of my preconceived idea of what Harry looks like. He fits the roll very well. I've seen him in several other roles on TV and he is a very good actor. The dialogue is great! All the characters are well defined and the actors do a good job in their respective rolls.
1,"Despite being a little slow I felt the greatest problem was how quickly it jumped into the main characters and their interactions with each other.  I would have preferred a little more build up, so not only so we (the audience) could get to know them a little (and relate to them all more), but so they could get to know each other better too; making their interactions more believable.  Another minor problem I had was that the main character (warning minor spoiler) seemed to be very much a spectator in his own life.  This was quite evident in by him being illiterate even after being over 100 years old.  Except for being able to throw a baseball well, and having an encyclopedic knowledge about the sport, he seemed to have picked up no other skills, no wisdom, no charm, etc...  Otherwise it was entertaining enough but a little slow with much left unexplained.  The overall pace and style reminded me very much of Let the Right One In (or Let Me In if you want the other version) but not quite as good."
1,Great movie
1,"Love this show: television at its best! Scripts involve great vocabulary -way beyond the third grade level of most shows. Chemistry between main characters, storyines, complicated characters, mix of sciencee/philosophy/sociology and psychology employ a wonderful way to spend 45 minutes!ðŸ˜€"
1,Great classic with two great stars
0,On par with some of the Stupedest shows ever created
1,Omg! Salma Hayek embodies the spirit of Frida Kahlo! Love both of these ladies! I can watch this movie over and over again!
1,"It was worth watching once, but not one of John C or Nicolas C's best movies."
1,Surprisingly entertaining.  Two thumbs up!
0,Meh. Most of the movie is pretty boring and seems to be a typical story line. Not very impressed. And Sophia wasn't looking too hot to be honest.
1,Superb writing and acting.
1,movie is good and I prefer the Spanish version than the English one .this film isn't too gore and it has a good plot.
1,Excellent Ken Burns documentary as usual. Must See!!
1,Very entertaining
1,"Seminal TV. Without this series breaking new ground there would be no Breaking Bad or  Mad Men. Demystifys the Mob with intelligence, wit and humour. What can I say that hasn't been already said? The writing, directing, camerawork and acting are off the charts. Well worth watching again and again."
1,"For the most part, historically accurate. The costumes, characters, acting and writing are good. It held my interest and I couldn't help myself but binge watch episodes into the early morning hours."
1,Surprisingly funny and heartwarming.
1,"Very true to the Mad Max franchise.  The direction, cinematography and production techniques all do a great job of making this feel like Mad Max in every sense of the word.  Lots of action and fairly good story-line, on the higher end of the violence scale.  It does require a certain amount of suspension of belief, but that's true of any Hollywood blockbusters these days (think Gravity)."
1,"Old Fashioned is a Christian romance movie all about chivalry. I have to say that this movie had good morals. However, there wasn't much of a plot and the movie moved really slow."
1,Great Series
1,The BEST Star Trek movie!!
1,Great series
1,One of my FAVORITE Series!!!!!!!
1,Should be a fun series.
1,Great show
1,"I blame my dearly departed mother for my loving The King and I. When I watch it she is with me and I feel her happiness and know she is in peace! I am deeply grateful that Amazon has instant videos for us to enjoy. It is soo very much worth the price! The only thing I wish which could be different is that the rental lasted for 48 hours instead of only 24. Sadly, I feel a deeeeppp, intense amount of pressure to watch whatever I have paid to rent. But, other than that I love being able to watch stuff I cannot seem to stop thinking about and longing for! I have loved the King and I since I was a small child. This movie is a part of how I was raised. It shall forever be a part of my heart. Way to go MOM!!"
1,Watch it!!
1,It's addicting. Good show!

1,Instant classic
1,So great
1,great for family relaxation
1,"Always great to see Foyle, but not quite up to some of the earlier seasons. Still worth the time though."
1,Great for grandchildren
1,Great show
1,yes
1,"Want to see more! Love good period pieces with flare! Right up my alley. Good story buildup and secondary characters, dramatic and humorous. Appears could deliver a great dishy rendition of the Casanova legend without being just about sex. Beautiful scenery, sets and costuming."
0,This is one of the worst interviews I have ever seen.  The moderator was clueless as to how to maintain forward direction and appeared completely unprepared.  How could she create something so boring with such fantastic actors and writers?  It felt like she had been asked to fill in 5 minutes before the show began!
0,"Too slow moving.  I am from NJ and thought I would enjoy it, but I was wrong.  A friend told me the first two shows are boring but then it gets better.  More violence I was told. To me not worth watching."
1,"Love it cannot wait for next episode, or try to find the time to watch."
0,Very slow and the plots are all over the place
1,Enjoying the series.
1,Grand daughter loved it
1,good movie.
1,"Meh, I loved the old creature features, but the narration lacked sufficient detail"
1,Very good
1,Excellent
1,I've definitely enjoyed the series so far and look forward to the next one being available on Amazon Prime!
1,Watched all 3 seasons I wish there would have been more.
1,Grandson loves to watch
1,Superficial portrait of an interesting man.
1,Great series
1,Love this kind of stuff. The idea is entertaining for sure and a part of me believes. The other part of me is religious with fate and all that fun stuff but I've put &#34;The Secret&#34; and idea of the Law of Attraction into practice and it's pretty neat.
1,Too much crap in it for me.
0,They  should not have called this a movie
1,Its ok
1,Great show
1,Love the cast of actors in here and funny too.
1,"Loved it then, love it now."

1,Amazing!
1,Great season!
1,Very different and very exciting.
1,This movie just brings back old memories of early history class.. I just always loved it..
1,Great fun -- can't wait for new seasons.
1,ok
1,Excellent
1,"Such a great series! My husband and I both found it riveting, beautiful, mysterious and magical!"
1,"This show is seriously funny. I am a comically jaded viewer, so it isn't easy for a show to make me actually laugh out loud let alone bring me to tears and split sides. This show does it for me, consistently. It's not just the low-view gems that they find on youtube and worldstar that make this show, Rob Dyrdek's comedy and presentation sends this show over the top into absolute hilarity. The guests they have are very hit or miss and the other two people on the show are alright, but it's all about Rob and the videos that some poor person finds while scouring through the depths of youtube. Buy it."
1,I loved the show but hated the ending
1,Can't wait for season 2!
1,"If you like Pierce Brosnan, then you'll like this film.  Predictable but entertaining."
1,Will there be a season five?
1,A great Peter O'Toole movie.  I've watched it many times over the years.  One of my favorites.
0,BEST DRAMA I HAVE EVER SEEN
0,It was OK.  I would not consider this to be a comedy though
1,Glad for the happy ending!
0,"Not great, not worth 19.99!"
1,Entertaining! And enjoyable.
1,Love the series
1,One of the better vampire flicks.
1,"IMHO I find this show as funny or more than Seinfeld.  &#34;LD&#34; Larry David is off the charts in the comedy<br />field today. I am so glad Amazon Prime picked this up from HBO, and I am privileged to be able to watch<br />the entire Seasons of shows because I never had HBO."
0,silly movie
1,Addictive show
1,Very much enjoyed this flash from the past. Since watching the Comption movie have been listening to a lot of 90s Hip Hop.
1,In treatment had me hooked!! Sad that it canceled... Left me hanging!
0,Okay but a little disconcerting.
1,"My 3 year old twin nieces love Umizoomi, and I have no guilt in letting them watch TV when it is on.  Great for learning!"
1,AWESOME!!!!
1,My kids love it and I enjoyed watching it with them
1,Very solid crime drama!
1,Keeps you engaged through the whole movie!
1,entertaining
1,"This movie was recommended by a USC Film teacher through the USC-KAFE program in L.A.. So, I decided to watch it and it was good. There was lots of mystery about who had killed a local girl. The Mother actress Joon-ho Bong son is being accused of killing the local girl and goes to jail. The Mother goes on a quest to find the murderer to get her son out of jail. But there is a twist her son is mentally challenged and this makes it challenging, when he can't remember what happened the night of the murder. It does have an ending twist and you must watch the movie!!!!"
1,AMAZING!!!
1,"Fast paced, exciting show. Looking forward to the next season. Great actors. A must see."
0,"way too grisly and horror filled for me, but the acting is interesting"
1,I am enjoying the story lines and the characters. Maggie Smith is amazing; I anxiously await her droll but hilariously funny lines.
0,"How many times can you watch someone running! I get the character had a lot of distance to cover, but did we really need to see the character in faux ninja pose?"
1,My Granddaughter absolutely loves Spomge Bob!  We can play this whenever she wants and don't have to mess with the CD player.
1,Awesome series. Please keep!!!!!
1,I'm not a fan but my Granddaughter is completely mesmerized by Dora. Since it does have some educational value I will give it 5 stars.
1,Great story's
1,"Not too bad of a film...  Decent acting and good filming quality; special effects, cameras/films used, ambience of the film, etc.  Story line was decent but the sci-fi film industry has been flooded (of) late, with the evil-alien agenda scenario/lost footage story lines."
1,Great show. Funny. Great writing.
0,Not good
1,Great show.
1,Charming.
1,It was ok not great
1,"This video in an in-dept look at how Studio Ghibli works day to day, in particular how Hayao Miyazaki ran his company. It gives you an inside look at how Miyazaki thinks, works, lives. It is interesting to see how this brilliant mind of a creative artist works, and how he delivers great films."
1,Awesome show!
1,Enjoyed it.  Had me laughing and smiling
1,Awesome family movie!
1,"I love team Umizoomi, I'm 47 and it really has changed how I think about tackling everyday life problems."
1,Worth watching over and over again
1,"This movie is great just because I like Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but  I did not love it."
1,Pretty light but entertaining.
1,"Just like the show, awesome!"
1,"Always loved this movie as a child.  Now at age 39, I watched it with my kids and still loved it.  My 5 year old son loves the characters just as much and asks to watch it over and over.  This is a true classic."
1,I love this movie .  Seen it a few times. Hilarious.
1,"Great story which helped me better understand children with autism, their parents, and their potential!"
1,Good movie.
1,Laugh out loud funny. Definitely one of the best I've seen in a while
0,"I could maybe give it a 4 or 5 stars, if I was able to watch it on my Fire TV Stick,  but since it never worked from day one,  about 3 months ago,  ZERO stars would be more appropriate..."
1,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
1,"Catastrophe is a refreshingly funny, like actually funny, comedy, which I find to be a very rare thing. I wish there were more episodes of the first season, because I enjoyed it so much. I'm very excited for season 2; it can't get here soon enough!"
1,"It's an ok show in season 1, but now it's getting more and more interesting by the episode."
1,Very interesting an unexpected twists and turns.
1,Great show really like it
1,Good movie never seen it
1,Great movie! ðŸ‘ðŸ»
0,With all the star power I expected a much better movie!  The script never really went anywhere.....
1,Classic
0,"Bizarre boring, just terrible!"
1,Hilarious and real. Rob and Sharon are also very likable. Make more episodes soon!!
1,"visual effects were great. the topic of artificial intelligence becoming self aware and a genius developer 'evolving' the models is quite interesting. There are a few kinks in the story line but thats a problem with most films, isn't it. I did enjoy it and as SCIFI fan can recommend it wholeheartedly."
1,Surprisingly funny and appropriate for all.
1,Great movie!
1,Okay...
1,Plot and actors continue to be high quality in their realistic portrayal of police family life.
1,Awesome
1,Love this show! It's amazing how talented these people are.
1,Great movie
1,victory!
1,Superb series! The Cambrige background is wonderful. James Norton is brilliant as is the entire cast. Add a black puppy named Dickens and you've got a winner.
1,"Excellent show, we binge watch all the time."
1,Kind of slow moving but story line is good!
1,"Amazing, Very well done. All of the shows in this series are exceptional."
1,Love this show.  Great start to Season 3.
1,entertaining
1,Excellent
1,Awesome very funny can't what for season 5
1,Every season was great and almost every episode.  Riveting.
1,Great series! People know way to little about this era and what it felt like 'over there'. Absolutely hooked.
1,Def watchable. Sweet. Enough drama to keep your interest.
1,"Great new season for those who love this show, Heidi and Tim.  Thank God there no more former winners and losers brought back.  All new designers.  However, the last winning design was hideous.  I cannot imagine any sane woman wanting to wear the dress.  It looked like the model had a gigantic blue tumor growing from her back.  It reminded me of the Sack dress that was popular for about 5 minutes in the 50s."
1,So great!
1,Amazing from beginning to end.  Won't be disappointed.
1,Good Movie
1,I loved it and my daughter watched it three times in less than 24 hours.
0,"If you are a Viking reenactor or enthusiast I have some advice for you, do not waste your time or money. This film is a complete joke! Within 5 minutes I knew I had made a mistake renting it.  The story line is predictable and boring. The costumes are completely fantasy based, and dont resemble anything even near to the time period potrayed. Everyone involved in this film needs to reevaluate what their goals are in the entertainment business and start over!"
1,A story that never ends.
1,One of the BEST. An excellent casted drama series with non- determined endings. Just waiting for the next series.
1,"Beautiful, exciting, and moving work of art."
1,Survivor is my favorite reality series.  I am so glad I can watch the former series for free on Amazon Prime.  Jeff Probst has come a long way in being an excellent host and really knows how the show works to be interesting for the viewer.
1,Loved it but would have liked a better ending.
1,"Haven't watched the whole thing yet, but WHOA it is good!"
1,Barefoot was good movie.  It took me a little bit of time to understand how the movie was showing the difference of how the girl would stay alive in the present or go into the bright light.
1,Great flick
1,"This was not a good movie, however, I rented it for my son to watch as he is reading the Olympian series. He enjoyed it."
1,"Story line makes no sense and the ending was one of the worst I have seen,,,,,"
1,Great video!
1,Have enjoyed every show.
0,I didn't care for the movie.
1,Good movie
1,Never fails to grab
1,Real old fashion movie. I enjoyed it.
1,Still loving it ....
1,witty all the way thru
1,Love it!!!
1,Good<br />Should have more episodes
1,"I LOVED this film, for a variety of reasons.  It's so real for a number of reasons.  The people are REAL people, the characters ring true.  The boys and their friendship portrays the essence of teen friendships everywhere, the sense of angst, of hope for the future.  It feels like it is a true-life love song to Northern Maine, which I think Aron and Gita, being Maine residents, capture so realistically."
1,very good movie . especially in uhd.
1,"A French comedy, really good one,  I was laughing all the time.  If you expect sex, you are misguided."
1,a good movie!
1,"Decent documentary, worth seeing. Found it a bit lacking on the Bad Seeds history, Blixa makes a brief, brief appearance etc. Starts strong but I found I lost focus in the last 20-25 mins."
1,can not wait for more!
1,Looking forward to more seasons.
1,This show doesn't disappoint.
0,"Rog is annoying.  There was so many times that I wished that I could throttle him for his chauvinistic behavior and just being a douche. The main guy...I think his name is Tim or something, he was a jerk and annoying as well. His acting was not believable at all and seemed forced.  The only characters that I liked were Harold, Chad and Julie.  This movie could have been better, but they didn't care to make it better.  The end scene didn't make much sense.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to be annoyed.  It just proves that there aren't any truly scary movies anymore."
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
1,Great show
0,"I suggest using &#34;Caillou&#34; on a continuous loop for suspected terrorists. This whiny, entitled, undisciplined, ungrateful brat has a way of getting under your skin and into your mind in ways the CIA could only dream."
0,Pretty odd movie. I did like that there was frontal nudity....but not pron.
0,too many scenes of nothing happening!
1,Great show.
1,Loved it very informative
1,"Looking forward to the next SEASON.  Interesting writing, story with a twist and ended on the edge...."
1,One of his best...hadn't seen it in years
1,Good movie
1,The best!
1,Another favorite
1,STALONE AND SCHWARTZNAGER WERE  VERY GOOD ENDING LEFT YOU A LITTLE MIXED UP.
1,Loved it....wished their would have been more seasons to watch!
1,Really good - conveys mystery and suspense without a lot of violence or sex or bad language. The people really have to act to convey their emotions! Good writing and plot lines.
1,Simply amazing action movie.
0,The film kept starting and stopping. I should get a partial refund.
1,Well done!
1,Great show
1,"Starting to get a little far out there, but still a good show"
1,"(Spoilers avoided!)  I've read a bunch of reviews of season 2, and they are all true, from the 1-stars to the 5-stars.  It's true that initially Molly didn't seem very ______ over the ______ of _____, that there is too much ___ compared to Season 1 which was more ______-friendly, that _____'s personality seemed to change rather abruptly and in an unwelcome fashion.  And there's definitely some sci-fi ____ going on.  And one thing I didn't read, somehow Molly seems to think that it's always her _________ to do things and that is a bit unbelievable.<br /><br />However, the plot is so compelling and fabulous and _unpredictable_ that I can just barely wait from when it is broadcast on Wednesday to when it is released on Amazon on Sunday to avoid all the commercials.  The show continues to surprise.  It's a delight.  I hope it renews for Season __!"
0,Horrible waste of time. Don't bother sitting through this.
0,"Not very funny,  Couldnt get past the 2nd episode"
0,Alright
1,Fun show! None of those annoying ghost hunters or goofy music. Just stories about haunted locations.
1,like Clint Eastwood movies.
1,"Visually engaging, but light on plot.  Lot's of sizzle, but not much steak.  Would of given a 3.5 if it was possible."
1,Can't wait for the next season
1,I've already written a review.  But here it is again.  A very excellently acted and directed movie of complexity and very thought provoking.
0,the translation were slow and ineffective and took too much away from viewabliity
1,Great episode quality. Love having subtitles!
1,Entertaining movie.  Enjoyed relaxing with a good movie!
0,Not very entertaining
1,"fun, campy, and visually interesting.  would like to see a cgi supported remake."
1,I liked it.
1,It was okay for what it was a boosted up Spy Kids and yet with Jessica Aba who is a good actress. A good cast as well in Samuel L. Jackson. I like how Hailee Steinfeld develop her character outside of her identity train agent. But to the Side Bar Review. Barely Lethal was quiet lethal!
1,"A very entertaining series. Unveils many unknown facts, history, and old common practices."
1,Addicting
1,Awesome police series set in NYC.
1,Best comedy series I've watched
1,"Classic &#34;old dark house&#34; comedy. Fun dialogue, goofy ending. If you liked &#34;Hold That Ghost&#34; then you'll probably like this"
1,Best television show I have ever seen. Everything is broken. Injustice is systemic.
1,Awesome movie
1,Love this movie!!
1,A realistic look at contemporary problems for normal adults.  Very well acted and photographed.
1,It's addictive!

1,We love every minute of it.
1,This show makes you want to watch.
1,Great TV show
1,"I remember seeing this series on HBO when it first aired. I liked it enough to come back pretty much every episode. Viewing it now, I wonder--why? Meh!"
1,"At times, brutally honest.  Good writing, great characters.  A must see for any couple."
1,"Fun to watch three middle-aged women decide that they want to do something totally different and go for it.  Making a movie is tough for anyone, but this really showed three woman focused on a dream."
1,"Great show!! Loved the costumes, the plot, the scenery. If you like history and enjoy watching customs and norms of Europe in the 18th century .. This show is a must see. I hope the series continues. Very entertaining. Diego Luna is at his best as usual."
1,"Absolutely superb movie! So well done, beautiful and well acted!! Loved it."
1,HILARIOUS!!!
1,Sweet movie!!!
1,This is only a OK MOVIE. Lots of things about sex and stuff have changed since then making this movie almost embarrassing to watch!
1,Entertaining action film with a lot of old stars from the eighties.
1,Hit home
1,Great series if you like Sci Fi stuff!!!
1,Oldie but a goodie.  Not the Duke's best but it's short.
1,"Typical 1950's nonsense. They had no real definition of what radiation was, nor did they understand most of what they said. The movie is short by our standards only 106 minutes, and it made many factual and physical mistakes. But as a forms of entertainment, it did what it is suppose to do. Not great, but not too terrible."
1,Great show.  Kids love it.
1,"Very romantic, sweet movie."
1,A perfect Love Story.

1,Super funny!
1,No
0,Is not what I was expecting .
1,"Great show, well worth watchin"
1,"Even though the story has evolved quite different than the book, it is still very interesting and has me on the edge of my seat with every episode.  Can't wait to see how it all ends!"
1,Very Violent and not believable.
1,"The story line was great in the beginning, but it is getting a little old school in season 3 ."
1,"Great actor, director and movie."
1,Hilarious! Love Ted Danson's character. I want to be an eccentric millionaire like him!
1,Totally Awesome!  Love The X Files!
1,I love the Lord and Lady of Highclere! (I'm not sure that I got there titles correct) but they are so down to earth and gracious to open there home to the world. Beautiful Castle!  I hope to see it in person some day!

1,Funny! Kept me intrigued. Great entertainment for all ages.
1,Very entertaining considering the dark subject matter.
1,"Love this show! I got hooked by accident looking for something to watch on Netflix and stumbled upon this little gem of a show. Syfy definetly got it right with this one, good mix of characters and entertaining story lines. If you're looking for a good syfy/mystery show, Haven is a great place to start!"
1,Very moving account of the situation in Mali.....
1,Good flick
1,Love these two actors
0,Has really gone down hill! Why isn't he looking for his family?
1,Awesome!
1,"Love this show, can't believe there was only one season."
1,Awesome show! It seems so real I forget I'm watching TV.
1,dated but I liked the movie
1,An exciting synopsis to the British SAS. No doubt there is a lot about the SAS they could not or would not reveal. but I suspect they are similar to our own Seal teams and the training they undergo.
1,why should I have to write anything?
1,Great
0,Just ok.
1,My favorite movie is &#34;Stardust&#34; and this is right up that alley for me. Maybe a little confusing upon first watch but I found it charming and emotional. Loved it!
1,Good show except the producers try to ram the gay lifestyle down our throats. Go figure
0,Just ok movie.  Not one that I would sayâ€¦you have got to see this one.  Not!
1,okay
1,"The story and the actors are wonderful.  However, the quality of the film is not up to today's standards.  This is the reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 5."
1,"Cute movie, funny. Annette Benning was hilarious."
1,Love British and Canadian TV and movies.  The complete difference in the two characters makes for interesting out comes.
1,"I loved this show since I was a child, but had forgotten most of the earlier episodes. Love getting to rewatch them again"
1,Very entertaining. Forgivably hokey.
1,"Rusty (Ed Helms) is grown and an airline pilot for a small airway. When the neighbors are over for dinner, he sees an enormous amount of father-son bonding, that he become envious and realizes his family is in a rut. He decides a vacation to Wally World (and not Paris) is what the family needs and announces to the audience &#34;The new vacation will stand on its own.&#34;<br /><br />His family is a bit dysfunctional.  We discover his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) was known as &#34;Debbie do anything&#34; in college. As a side note, I don't believe there is a Memphis State University, but the University of Memphis is a dry campus. Kevin (Steele Stebbins) the younger son swears excessively, wrestles, and likes to bully his older brother James. James (Skyler Gisondo) who &#34;doesn't have a vag.., but it would be okay if he did&#34;, keeps a wish diary.<br /><br />The film was funny. The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.<br /><br />Guide:  Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity."
1,Just as I remembered it.
1,i watch a new episode every day.
1,Weakest of the seasons so far. Michael Rappaport's awful accent made his scenes almost unbearable. Poor casting choice.
1,Good move. Leaves a few things to the imagination. Does not follow the zombie convention
1,"Totally enjoyed the all these movies, I've watched them multiple times."
1,Classic film.  Outstanding.
1,Awesome series!  Great cast.
1,Has its moments and Ron Eldard is good
1,My wife and I are enjoying this BBC series very much.
1,"Seriously love this show, can't wait for the new season"
0,Had high expectations because I am a huge Walking Dead fan. This was slow and boring with a dull plot line
1,Very good
1,EXCELLENT... on all accounts!
1,Very entertaining series. Kinda fun to see the cameos. I got the sense the writers were running out of ideas. The business is nothing but a roller coaster for studios and actors. But how many times can you come back from the dead?  It was time.
1,Amazing!!!!
0,"OK movie if you are looking for mindless goofy fun and are bored. Plot was pretty out there and had really no tie-in with the original cartoon. I could do without Megan Fox.....eye candy yes, but worthless as an actress. Overall......meh."
1,Dark humor. Good just not completely developed.
1,My granddaughter  loves it.
1,Cool
1,A super dreamy man you want to root for! Perfect if you love Downtown Abbey or Outlander.
1,i love it
1,great
1,"I'm always years behind the power curve. Missed this excellent series when it appeared originally. Has the attraction of a dystopian series, good acting, and a believable plot.I find myself watching episode after episode, non-stop, the sure mark of a good series (at least for me)"
1,I really liked this. I like seeing how it all started
1,"Definitely one of the all-time classics , video qualit is pretty good"
1,"Shows how Atlantic City, NJ was at the center of the Prohibition gangster organization.  The rise of Al Capone is also shown.  I highly recommend this series."
1,Great
1,Great television
1,Great season!
1,Very imaginative and entertaining
1,"This is a charming, excellent movie---very well-acted and scripted.  I highly recommend seeing it."
1,I absolutely love this movie. I love Thomas Jane's performance. And everyone else's as well.
1,"We never saw the original series when it came out. Fun diversion, mind candy, easy to watch and enjoy. Great TV; nah. Great fun; definitely."
1,"I'm no wimp when it comes to gore (at least I don't think I am) and certainly no prude about sex.  But if you are, look elsewhere. The story is certainly secondary."
1,Keep your Kleenex handy as you watch this heart strings puller. Robert DeNiro is great as the disconnected father. The daughters also pull off reasonable performances.
1,Loved it.
1,GREAT WATCH
1,Fantastic series! Love it.
1,"I have enjoyed several of the Amazon Originals, so decided to give this a try.  Glad I did, enjoyed it and it shows great promise for another hit.<br />Thanks Amazon!"
1,I love Larry David!!
1,Great story with attractive characters. Follow the storyline from Season 1 until the end.
1,This has been a fun series so far.  The characters are developing and becoming familiar.  Sometimes it is annoying when the so called &#34;bad guy&#34; is overdone.  The series is well cast and light in spirit.
1,A beautifuly done film.  Uncomfortable but tragic.
1,Love it!
1,Just got into True Blood a couple of weeks ago. So much better than Twilight...
1,Great movie
1,"Nice story , imagine if it were a big budget film ....good job guys"
1,My daughter loves this show ! We have fun watching! Very magical!
0,"Had won several sundance awards, so is reason started to watch.  I should learn that Asian Crush films are not to my liking."
1,"Great movie, kept me on the edge of my chair!"
1,Great series that is very well written.
1,"Great series, keeps me coming back for more!"
1,Completely addicted to this series!!
1,"I enjoyed this show, but not as much as the original."
1,Exciting as usual !!
1,Easily one of the most beautiful animated movies I have ever seen.
1,Amazing speech. Left me with food for thought
1,Great!
1,Really good movie
1,Another Great Season!
1,Great fire series slightly different than American fire seevice. I don't think kids mind.
1,"My mate told me to watch some other show and wouldnt give me the files for season 7 and 8 unless i watched it first and then answered a questionnaire based on the show's events. Told him to go experience intercourse with himself and got me a Prime membership trial instead, I now have one less friend but the 22 40 minute episodes will forever remain in my heart, and my hard drive, unlike friends, who DIE!"
1,Awesome show!!
1,the movie was great I enjoyed it very much the action keep you on the edge of your seat.I say it again the movie was great!!!
1,This season was great!
1,Awesome movie
1,"Love it, can't wait for more"
1,"Great show,funny, smart and engaging. I never binge on tv shows but this was something I couldn't stop watching until season 3 was over... then I was sad as I wanted more."
1,Lots of fun. Good acting great adventure scenes.
1,I've put off watching this show for a while but I finally gave it a chance and Mr. Selfridge is such an amazing show! You find yourself attached to just about all of the characters and it's so hard to just watch one episode at a time! Highly recommendeded!
1,"The 100 offers a very original spin on a post-apocalyptic world. Because of this originality, the show keeps you craving more."
1,love the show very addictive
1,"Great series, didn't think I would like sci-fi but I like this one."
1,Great series and well worth my time.  Thank you all that served in our armed forces to keep our country free and safe.
1,Great cooking knowledge show!
1,"I adored this movie, great ending, too. So Proud!"
0,Better than I thought.  Ending a bit disappointing. Good for a rainy day if your an Adrian Paul fan.
1,"One of my favorite movies of all time.  The glue on the chair, the revolving door, half a mustache- hilarious!"
0,didn't watch all of it... kind of gave up on it...but partly becuase something came up and never went back to finish it...others may like if they watch whole film...
1,GREAT movie. I forgot how much bad stuff it has in it though.
1,Love this show but wanted the Ryan philleppe version.
1,Hoorah
1,Loved it
1,"All I can say is that I am sorry the next season is the last. I love this series. The acting, setting, and furnishings all remind me of a world gone by. Start with season 1 and binge watch! :)"
1,great
1,My 4 & 6 year old nieces give it 100 stars!
1,Clint is the best
1,The best chemistry duo since Will and Grace
1,fascinating!
1,Liked it an look forward to more episodes. Giovanni Ribisi is entertaining as always.
1,Such a good show! All very talented actors. Story line is different every week.
1,"Classic John Carpenter. Great opening scene, sets the tone for the whole movie. Eerie bonfire story chillingly told by A.E. Houseman."
1,Waiting to be continued
0,Didn't like it
1,It's a hoot!
1,Excellent drama from script to acting.
1,"I found this series to be quite riveting because it is based on a true story. The heartache and challenges of the family are just as engaging as those of the 'clients' he is attempting to help. The main character's conflict of belief and commitment to a 'promise to god' made at an agonizing point in his life, is compelling. I was fully invested in the characters through every episode of Season 1 and I do want to know what happens in Season 2.  I am glad this popped up on my Prime recommendations.  I had not heard of this series and Benjamin Bratt is pretty darn good in the lead role."
1,"We laugh with every episode, so funny!!"
1,"Just as visually stunning, lush and full of drama as the previous seasons, Season 5 left us wanting more!  From the teenagers to the grandparents, everyone in this household loves it!!"
1,great show...read all the books...needs a bit more levity to balance seriousness of drama for me...glad stories are finally being filmed<br /><br />tough to airplay on our television using Apple TV...must be an easier way?!?!?
1,ðŸ’˜ this show.
1,ghg;
1,"Some of the scenarios are a little over the top, but seeing actors challenged to be so versatile is delightful. And, of course, Eliza Dushku is always fun to watch."
1,"Very good Denzel Washington movie. Its as good as a more current movie of his, Equalizer."
0,"Very poorly done.  Perhaps a good idea, but not executed well.<br />This video is a bad series of talking heads, none of whom have the time to flesh out what they have to say.  The doctors on the panel are probably quite smart and very sincere, but they are poorly used.<br /><br />The world could use some good &#34;how to beat (type 2) diabetes&#34; videos.<br />This is not it."
1,Love this show! This is the one show my love and I can enjoy together n can't wait till next one!
1,Takes me back to my teenage years.
1,So funny.
1,"I am enjoying this season and don't want it to stop, but it seems the story line is running out of steam."
1,Great sports story and many good lessons taught!
1,Great series!
0,"Pure Hollywood, liberal junk."
1,"Love the movie, just was disappointed in the ending."
1,A+
1,Awesome movie.
1,great movie
1,Awesome
1,"I'm really excited to see how this show develops. It has relatable characters, great humor, dialogue that doesn't seem at all forced and interesting characters. Looking forward to Season 2~"
1,"While we wait for the new season to begin, we are rewatching all of the previous Grimms and loving it!  We usually watch an episode every night.  They run about 44 minutes, so they are very short and don't interfere with the rest of the night."
1,I find Bosh very entertaining.
1,Great series.
1,We have watched most of season ! and plan to watch all the seasons.  This is a very well crafted and acted adult drama without any salacious or tawdry content.  TV at it's best
0,Poor movie
1,just fair I guess!
0,waste of time
1,Fantastic.
1,"One of the most encouraging, inspiring movies I've seen this decade.  Not for everyone to go out and buy a zoo....but rather, what is YOUR zoo?  Where might you take the risk of investing yourself fully in life, collaborate with others, overcome obstacles, and have fun along the way.  20 seconds of courage-- sometimes that's all it takes -- and we all have that!"
1,Watch a show every night love it
1,Very good quality. Love the show!
1,I have watched this movie over and over and still find it to be hysterically funny!  The comedic timing is perfectly balanced with the realities of not quite closing a chapter before opening another and the empowerment of starting over and succeeding can give to women who embrace it.
1,"It is one of the greatest show I have seen, it is base on a realistic view of how life mistakes can result on a life changing expiriance. The only draw back is that they release all the episode on the same time they should do it one per week."
1,Relationships and their aftermath.
1,Very Clever!
1,Very slow in developing the story.
1,Great show
1,Enjoyed
1,"Not quite what I expected. Having read a lot about the WWII tragic building of the railroad through the jungle, I expected more of the brutal Japanese treatment."
1,very well made
1,Slow but good
1,Superb. But only for people who are smart enough to get the underlying point
1,my 3 yr. old grand daughter was totally into this!
1,"Classic film. A great example of an extinct style of animation: Rotoscope. Watch with context. This film was way ahead of its time. The movie paved the way for many films, including Peter Jacksons LOTR trilogy. Jackson will never admit it, but he used many of Bakshis scenes to block out his camera and action for the live action trilogy.<br />Too bad Bakshi ran out of money. The movie ends in the middle of the triloigy, and very abruptly. Still fun to watch."
1,The kids enjoy this show.
0,"Couldn't even get most of the way through it before I had to shut if off; couldn't even handle it as background noise while I cleaned.  Absolutely awful and not original in the slightest. Evan Rachel Wood's performance is sickeningly &#34;sweet&#34; and just embarrassing. Huge piece of fluff; perfect for those looking for a PG, make you feel good, faux conflict sort of movie."
1,Great Movie! :-)
1,"There are some excellent, very witty and clever moments, just not enough to be totally redeeming.  The episodes of this show are too short to fill with enough of the redeeming moments to make the view worthwhile.  If you binge-watch, as I did, then you will probably feel there are sufficient ha-has.  So do as you like, binge or not.  You know what works best for you......."
1,Good movie
1,Great series!!
1,Truly great!
1,First year was a little slow and predictable. Every season after has been a pleasure to watch.
1,Twists and turns. Great for a horror flick...
1,Great TV with great family values.
1,"Carey Mulligan does a superb job in this romantic melodrama.  Predictable, fun and beautifully staged, edited and directed. If you love romance and beautiful scenery you will not be disappointed!"
0,Very boring
1,"Sneaky Pete, you got to love a late blooming amateur who is trying to find to stay away from his dangerous previous life of crime.  Great atmosphere (real snowfall, not filmed in L.A.) with a strong cast that makes the most of a well written script"
1,"Great show, very historically faithful."
1,"It may be silly to add yet another 5-star review to this show that has already gotten 14,000+ votes - but let me just say that as a 60-something couple, my wife and I really enjoyed this show. Edgy, but lots of heart - the only scene that rang with falsehood was (unfortunately) the &#34;big scene&#34; in the final episode. Too much, too sudden, too soon. But I think I know where it's going.<br /><br />Guess we'll just have to war for next season to find out!"
1,Cheap japanese monster film fun.
1,Still enjoying this show!  : )
1,This is an excellent series.  Well written and produced.  I will hate to come to the end of the series.
1,I love this show.  Aaron Sorkin has another great series.
1,The Strain is one of the best TV series I've seen. It has an excellent story and characters with actors to match. Cool special effects round it out making it worth watching.
1,"Great for kids, wish there was more of them!"
1,I think it is typical Dicken's which I love. The picture quality isn't great. You definitely need to use closed captioning but it is well done for the time. Hard not to compare to quality of Little Dorrit but same Dickenesque genre. I haven't read the book but I can't help but feel that there are some gaps in the story. I will find out as I continue to watch the series and eventually read the book!
1,I enjoyed this heartwarming movie.
1,Amazing acting
1,Very intriguing. Ending was kinda surprising. I will watch the second season
1,A serious movie from Smith as he takes on religious zealots with several digs at the governments heavy handed approach. Good flick. No real twists or turns like many of his movies. Worth watching.
1,"This documentary shows how consumerism & the fashion industry has NOT benefited those workers in third world countries but brings great profits to the companies involved and lower costs, especially for Americans.  Like so many industries, the focus is on the bottom line and little else. In the end we all pay the cost"
1,Good movie. Enjoy watching it.
1,Good sequel
1,Has similar themes to the &#34;Lost&#34; series that we were captivated by
0,Very dated.  No special effects.  Story line is pretty lame and unimaginative.
1,Good plot if you can overlook police without guns. Script writers must have an extensive vocabulary as they only used Fbombs a few times per episode. That is a major accomplishment.
1,My so loves the show
1,"the acting was great,  what a great movie"
1,Excellent show for mystery fans.  Cast is outstanding.
1,Awesome show!
1,children enjoyed it
1,It grows on you
1,best historic mini series I have ever seen.
1,great - so interesting - good acting and story line!
1,Good drama without overdoing it.
1,"I liked it didn't expect to but it was reAlly creative, fast , gripping tale"
1,nice i love every minute of it
1,Best 'Die Hard' move I've seen in years!
1,Forgetable
1,Wonderful series
1,Awesome movie
1,Very enjoyable...like a mix between the movie National Treasure and the campy TV show Friday the 13th.
1,My granddaughter loves this series!
1,Like a lot
1,I discovered this show after a collection of episodes was added to Netflix and now I can't get enough. I love to see how Hilary rearranged and redesigns the homes to make them work for the families. I love the surprise at the end when finding out if the family will love it or list it.
1,Love it
1,Truly funny & original w/ quality actors!!!!
1,Can't wait for season 2!!
1,"Great, REAL, important"
1,"Sort of a dumb, overdone premise, but scary enough if you ignore all the goofs."
1,Great story
1,"The moment I saw the cast list, I knew I had to watch this movie. I was not at all disappointed! Great movie. &#60;3"
1,This series is addicting . I am saving the last episode because it will be a while until season 4. So much drama. Lovable and loathsome characters.
1,Can't wait to watch the next episode.
0,"Had to stop watching when I realized it would be all talk about his opinions rather than an interesting religious perspective. I feel sorry for his wife after seeing the small portion of this that I could sit through without vomiting. I stopped as soon as he said men should never watch their wives breastfeed. He is a bit confused and very infantile and limited in his understanding of the female and male mind, love, and what makes sex amazing!"
1,Awesome
1,Good show!  They should continue the series.
1,Fantastic!
1,Good movie.
1,I'm really enjoying the step back in time.  Thank you for making this series available!
1,"Funny as hell, lots of heart. Great writing. Can't wait for season 2!"
1,This Season is Awsome
1,Love this show can't wait to see more
1,"Fun & funny movie to watch with the kids!  Also drives home a few points about bullying and understanding that people make mistakes, but its how you recover from them that is important!"
1,GREAT TV SHOW. TONGUE IN CHEEK KINDA SHOW.THUMBS UP !!
1,Great movie. Profound message as Phil struggles to find meaning in a seemingly pointless existence. Great ending!
1,Love it.
1,Just love it!
0,not much here.
1,"Best entertainment every.  Good music,drama and above average production"
1,"I resisted watching this at first, but once I did, found it to be amazing.  Bothe the plot and acting are truly incredible. A different and fascinating look at family relationships."
1,Okay series but falls short of &#34;The Hour&#34; which was a much better news room program.
1,"Seriously, if it were possible, I would have given this movie a &#34;10 star&#34;!! Well worth watching over and over again!! Matthew McConaughey, as expected, was extraordinary!! Loved this!!"
1,"I LOVE KEVIN SORBO, BUT I &#34;HATED&#34; HIM IN THIS ROLE.  BUT I STILL DID VERY MUCH ENJOY THE MOVIE"
1,Grandkids loved it!!
1,"This show has some pretty big shoes to fill, so far it has been pretty good! Can't wait for next episode!"
1,hooked on Justified!
1,Good
1,Great fun program. My kids live it. Wish they hadn't changed the welsh accent. Not a fan of the American accents
1,Great clean movie.
1,After seeing all of the data mining and privacy invasion taking place with iOS and Windows 10 I just had to watch this old movie again. I think I enjoyed it now more than the first time because it's not as far off from reality as it was at the time the movie was released.
1,"Refreshing series - compelling plots, understandable dialogue, outstanding actors.  Waiting for Season 2!"
1,"The issues regarding the abysmal state of the US media and news circus are real and high time that a player such as HBO has stepped up to the plate. The show's personal stories, tho', suck royally and belong on midday soaps.<br />The direction is competent, if unoriginal. Good production values.<br /><br />The writing is too wordy, not giving the viewer enough time to consider the issues and take them outside the show and into the real world.<br /><br />Acting is fair to good. Mortimer is terrible, and comes across as a lachrymose bimbo largely because of the writers' inability to divest themselves from the TV soapy format. Guys: get a day job and work, or try working, for a female executive. But first get steel tempered underwear. The Jane Fonda character is the most grown up of the lot. I expect that she may've had a clause in her contract to shape her role more to her excellent commonsensical grasp of reality. Daniels character is equally formulaic, i.e., boring. Charismatically boring.<br /><br />Bottom line: good show with lots of room for improvement. This show should be an inspiration, instead of a nice way to kill time."
0,cliche and tacky.
1,Like ik
1,Love the show.
1,Adored both of these movies!  They are so uplifting.
1,Need another season to watch
1,Me and my wife loved it. Cliff hanger first season
1,"Beautiful, fun - I loved it!"
1,I liked the idea of this one.  Time travel with a little horror thrown in. It makes you think!
1,"I did the camino this past summer so watching again this movie brought back some good memories. I was disappointed to hear that Martin Sheen had not walked, at least part of it himself. Still a good movie"
1,My daughter loves it
1,Great show
0,"Too much vulgarity for me. It distracts from the comedy rather than enhancing it. I did not finish watching the shows, which is a shame. I liked the situations and actors."
0,it jumped around too much.
1,this film was OK....
1,Can't wait to see more...Very interesting concept.
1,Very good!my granddaughter enjoyed  it.
1,A little history and a lot of beauty!
0,"Slow and depressing story, however the actors did a good job with their parts."
1,"clever, quick witted, funny, great characters, incredible acting, very fun...can't wait for next season, love these two."
1,It was pretty good.  Hopefully they will continue to make more episodes.
1,Nicely done
1,My son loved this movie
1,"It's a wonderful series that we enjoy watching always.  Good, clean, entertaining TV."
1,A little known movie that is hilarious and shares a good message.
1,A bit of over acting. Fun to see the people in the roles
0,"Boring,  made no sense"
1,Great movie and storyline (based on a true story) but it was a little slow in parts.  Would recommend seeing it.
1,Excellent viewpoint - show stresses conscientious effort one should put forward. Makes me feel there is still hope for the country.
1,"I would go to 4.5 stars for superb cast, good sets, and timely story line."
1,Pretty good series... First season was very funny. I really enjoyed it.
1,loved it
1,It is a good depiction of Augustus' rise to power and interesting relationship he had with his daughter Julia whom later would be exiled to Pontus. There are some inaccuracies in the story and the costumes are lavish but again some minor mistakes here and there which does not detract from the movie plot or story. It is decent story of the beginning of the Roman Empire
1,Awesome show
0,"First season had an interesting premise; however, the second season took a bad turn and season three is just awful."
1,Amusing past time.....worth the two hours....but forgettable...enough said.
1,Great show-keep it going Amazon!!
1,This was a great pilot and Giovanni Ribisi was wonderful in it. I truly hope they make more episodes.
1,"The show was great, but the streaming was very choppy ;(.<br />We are using a Sony bluray player and comcast Internet, medium tier ( I pay extra for &#34;better than basic&#34; speed."
1,Goofy and hilarious
1,I was hooked on the 1st episode
1,"Great cast, good performances, good movie."
1,"Older moview but we enjoy watching it once in a while. Good message for the kids, good effects, acting meh... but the kids dont care."
1,"Love this movie, masterfully crafted, one of my favorites."
0,Acting was stilted.  burt Reynolds acted like he really has mental problems.  Story weak.  The best actor was the dog.
1,If the show stayed with what they did in episode one I would have enjoyed it more.  Too much personal stuff and behavior that would have had people in HR or terminated for sexual harassment.
0,Horrible
1,It was alright. Just a little disappointed but still a movie to watch because it's a little messed up!
1,Still good
1,"This is a graphic, realistic look at the camps, filmed right after liberation.  I was stunned at how many people handled the corpses without gloves on.  The Allies forced the local townspeople that lived near the camps to walk through the camps to see the atrocities committed by their government.  These people walked in smiling; different story on the way out.  Some fainted, some got sick and the rest were absolutely horrified seeing the piles of corpses, starving people near death and even furniture made of human skin!  This is a must watch for those that are holocaust deniers."
1,A real fun remake. Great effects.
1,Awesome old SpongeBob.
0,"Terrible language, great idea.  Just couldn't keep watching because of the vulgar language."
1,Love this show!
1,"We love the rockettes and would love to see more shows, besides the Christmas one, all during the year."
0,Very strange.
1,Great item
1,Intriguing and snake like lawyers
1,Movie what's good
1,"Everyone agrees, I think, that this is a terrific &#34;prequel&#34; to a terrific series. Shaun Evans makes it, though his mentor, Thursday, is a huge assist. Season 2, Episode 3 was the best of the first two seasons. The season finale went a trifle over the top. But the writing is generally superb and I can't wait for the third season. Best British detective series since Foyle's War."
1,Extremely authentic. It feels almost like you're in battle with these guys. Terrifying
1,"Feels like a kid show at first, but truly a beautiful and inspiring story any adult could relate to.  All characters and plot very well conceived. HIGHLY recommend. Also, really great lessons for children without being annoying."
1,"This is a story of love(may one sided love) and forgiveness. Although Ameer makes a ridiculous decision that I could never make, I respect his courage to move forward. I would love to see a part 2 to learn how this family is doing today."
1,"My daughter loves this show! I enjoy it too, she actually pays attention and understands what they teach her. Hopefully it will help with potty training because she watches that episode a lot."
1,"Lots of action, good FX, and a cool, kinda heady plot. Love this flick."
1,Good move
1,The only thing wrong with the series is it ended....and they killed off Omar!
0,stupid
1,Love this show.  Actors and writing are so absolutely perfect.  My only complaint is that the third season was disappointingly short.
1,"Tremendous, touching story that deserves much higher acclaim than the critics have it."
1,A great show loved it from start to finish.
1,Really great!
1,FUN!!!!!!!!!!
1,"This is an incredible series, on par with Season 1 of True Detective...perhaps even better."
1,This show has me hooked. Love the characters!
1,Everyone in the house loved it!
1,Great show!
1,AA++
1,Want to see more
1,Both Egan and Wisdom are very convincing. The more I watched this the more able I was to &#34;suspend my disbelief&#34;. The antagonist in this movie has reminded me of what evil really looks like. For Sci-fi buffs I highly recommend this.
1,Mainly rivoting.
0,Makes police departments appear very inept.  One of most convoluted stories ever.  Felt completly discombobulated after watching hours of this confusion ......don't waste your time
1,"Good movie, but a little strange.do not think I would share my husband with you sister!"
1,Great
1,Love this show!
1,Great show.  My 2.5 year old loves it :-)
1,Love this show!
1,Tatiana is amazing! You would never know she's plays 5 different people !!
1,Came to an abrupt end with little story development
1,Excellent entertainment
1,Of course...incredible reflection of the 60's....a lasting tale
1,"I can't get enough of this series!  LOVED Season 3, my favorite so far.  Impressed with the last episode.  Waiting impatiently for Season 4!!"
1,Excellent Film.
1,Looks like this will be a good Hood vs Society Flix
1,"Good movie, expected more action but the cast of actors in this film were great. Enjoyed all of their performances."
1,We have not been disappointed yet.
1,We enjoyed this.  Well written and acted.
1,"Interesting characters, good acting and an unusual story line in a unique location held my interest generating some intense binge-watching. Wish the series did not end with season 6."
1,Really well done!
1,Action packed with a perfect balance of wit & humor.
1,A must watch
1,Letters To God is a tender story leaving the viewer with food for thought because of the wisdom of the young boy.  Many sad moments but worth getting to know the characters.
1,Wonderful!  I TOTALLY recommend watching.
1,ok
1,Great movie Mel Gibson at his best
0,Very depressing
1,I like the story which sometimes is the story when you get older.
0,There isn't one thing nice to be said about this piece of work.
1,Every season has been great.  can't wait to watch the next one.
1,I love this movie and the other 2 with Kimberly J Brown(I don't like the latest movie)! Can't wait to watch them every year.
0,What was this about. These's an added discussion that tries to explain. What's with the spider?
1,"Typical, but good for those not in medical field...."
0,"This is the second time trying to put my review, I did follow amazon guidelines,  there is nothing ad , bad word or whatever breakning the rules.<br />Mas o menos entretenida, me aventure a comprarla al ver que era el director de cuervos y el actor, la historia entra enlo chafa cuando los ricos se enamoran y hacen amigos de los pobres , como si fuera novela mexicana, tiene sus partes entretenias y nomas"
1,Ok
1,If this series had their own version of &#34;Saul Goodman&#34; it would be right up there with Breaking Bad.
1,"I enjoyed this documentary very much. The staff really amazed me how devoted they are to the animals in their care. Even tasks like shoveling s##t was taken in stride as just another part of the job they seem to love. The staff found humor in the animal antics like escaping, fighting, or just plain being stubborn. Had a little difficulty with the Irish accents but otherwise truly enjoyed it."
1,"Enjoyed this movie.  It was though provoking and kept me interested.  There was frontal nudity of both male and female actors, but it was not a trashy movie by any means.  I recommend this."
1,Good movie!
1,This was a random find on Prime Instant Video and I have really enjoyed a show that depicts the behind the scene perspective of the newsroom.
1,Very funny show with a great cast
1,Great
1,It's cute. Entertained my 4yr old daughter. Could use a little differentiation on the story line. Each episode is very much the same.
0,Not a movie that I would rent again.  Moves slow and did not hold my interest.
1,"Pretty good overall. It was very interesting, just do not see the need for every other word to be the &#34;F&#34; word!!! Geez!!! Get a dictionary and get a vocabulary!!!!"
0,I don't think they are funny
1,Funny stuff for those of us in the 30-50 year old crowd.
1,This is a movie I used to watch in cable as a teenager and I like it.
1,Being burnt out on on original Walking Dead so gave this one a try. I am sure TWD fans will love this one too. Just more of the same for me. I get they want it gritty and real life. But its too dark for me. If I want this dark I will just continue reading ISIS news headlines.
1,the best cartoon ever
1,"I was a protectionist at a local drive-in for more years than I would admitt. God I miss the drive-in. I spent each summer working at three and each one was a different experience. Coming Attractions nails it 100 percent, no doubt. Show your children what was real family entertainment."
0,Bad ending
1,I'm hooked!
1,"Nudity is overdone a bit-lots gore, surprises, but it is a bit addictive. The good guys don't always win."
1,"Intelligent writing, great directing, and flawless acting."
1,Hope there will be more soon.
1,"This is a fine movie that does a great job of building characters to whom the audience can relate. It is, in my opinion, a rare sort of movie that entertains while dealing with some very profound issues. I didn't think I would like it much when I read about it but I was pleasantly surprised. It is a hidden gem of a movie."
1,Great film
1,With Morgan Freeman in it how could it go wrong. Great story
1,"Have viewed all seasons now, highly recommend if you are interested in timeline Tudor history and somewhat truth..lol.. it's all quite interesting.  Worth the seasonal watch."
1,"Not great (only because it's like The Thing, but on a boat) but certainly worth watching..."
1,Great movie
1,What can I say? It has my favorite villain?!
1,We are ready for more episodes!
1,This is a wonderful compilation.
1,"Oddball movie (in French English sub-title), but really good."
1,Good movie!
1,Wonderful family drama great acting!
1,A well told story of the special bond between humans and dogs!  Highly recommend this one!
1,Great show
1,Love it
1,"Story line was great, not so much sex and violence."
0,Silly special effects are used to breathe life into a very weak story.  No success.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKlellan were wasted.  Too bad.
1,Thumbs up.
1,Good
1,Great show!
1,Another unbelievable season of suspense!!!
1,Loved it. Can't wait for Season 5.
1,Cute movie. Kids love it!
1,It's Michael Jordan and Warner Bro cartoon characters for goodness sakes!
1,Interesting series.
1,"The whole series is must see, today's programming doesn't hold a candle to this series."
1,"If you like quirky, wacko sci-fi, then you will like this. Lots of wacky symbolism and all that stuff. You can look for meaning in the meaningless."
1,"The photography was exceptional, as was the character development and the acting."
1,awesome show
1,Great show!
1,If you like quickly British humor you will love this show.
1,I love it
1,Best movie out of both trilogies.
1,Awesome show. Can't stop watching.
1,"I give it 5 stars because of how it perfectly depicts true combat without the glamor and glory we too often see in Hollywood. It is raw and brutal. The hatred of opposing sides is felt and seen. The evolution from new guy to loss of innocence to war-torn veteran. It shows a lot of scenes that not even Band of Brothers perfectly captured. Toggling &#34;the switch&#34; between seeing a buddy killed, but also having to stay in the fight until it's over. Very well done movie. (Reference: fought in Iraq 2006, 2007, 2008)"
1,It's a classic and still great.
1,"These guys make really beautiful cars and really terrible business decisions. You get the entertainment of seeing into the minds of hoarders, without the stuff that makes you gag (eg. dead cats, roaches, all of the nasty stuff that you see on other hoarding shows). There are some really stunning cars on here. Another nice thing is that you really feel like they are doing good things for these hoarders. It's an uplifting show. I just wish that they could actually make some money. Great show. I can't wait for the next season."
1,This is a comedy series about (some seriously) flawed people in a family with basically a good heart.
1,I rented this movie from Netflix.  This one touched my heart.  I have got to own a copy.
1,As an adult I'm not sure what to make to Tumble Leaf. All I know is my 5 yr old and my 2 yr old love it. It's a very colorful show.<br />It's a gentle calm show that I don't find insulting to anyone's intelligence.
1,"so cute. But i didn't tell my kids it was based on a real person because, 10 years after this movie was made, forensic evidence proved Anastasia did not survive. her life actually had a very tragic end that i do not care to explain to them at their young age."
1,It was an ok movie.  Teen romance movie. Its what a teen thinks love is all about.
1,"I really do love the show even though sometimes it gets a little bit too political.  Apparently, Larry David really is very, very Liberal and I am very, very Conservtive BUT I really do enjoy the show."
1,It was just &#34;O.K&#34;.
1,"A friendly review of Welles's works. No demeaning of the man and for these I thought it was good- in fact, it boosted the man by showing without being to pointed about it, his tenacity regarding his art- going back over and over again to a piece of film as he was able to get money together. My only 'complaint'?...It needed to be longer"
1,Cute show! My five year old loves it!
1,There are interesting discussions about this complex and deeply spiritual man.
1,Great ending to an awesome show!
1,Can't get enough of this show. Keeps you on the edge.
0,Two stars is generous
1,"For a childrens movie it was ok, not what I thought it would be."
1,This band is amazing.
1,All top actors - and a great story.  This was high pressure telemarketing - and con combined!  Jack Lemon - over the top!  As was Pacino
1,Some whst boring starting out maybe  it will get better I have to give it a chance  I'm a big fan of Walking Dead
1,"Good Plot, action."
1,Awesome movie! Full throttle all the way.
1,"Great show. Loved the books, loving the show."
1,"If you love Jane Austen, and especially Pride & Prejudice, you will love this movie."
1,Ok
1,Good movie! Did not like the ending
1,"I really got into this program.  It started out a little slowly but came together very well.  The characters were unique and interesting, and I was very disappointed to find out it was not being renewed.  I think this was a great series and I would have stayed with HBO if it had continued, as they sure don't have much else of this caliber currently."
1,A feel good movie. Nothing over the top.
1,I like Clint Eastwood so I really liked this movie.
1,Fun movie. Just don't have super high expectations. It is what it is.
1,fascinating look at the creation of Big Bird and the man who controls / invented him.
1,Dated but well done!!!
1,Just see it!!
1,"Cute movie, fun to watch.  Just entertaining"
1,Love it!!
1,"Excellent show, a riot, tender, smart...<br />Can't wait for season 2.<br />I am a  new fan of Jeffrey Tambor and Judith Light."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised at this series. It is not sensationalized speculation about aliens or conspiracies. Rather, each episode takes a subject and walks you through what happens to it in the museum, behind the scenes. There is a little getting-to-know the people there but its not a reality television thing at all. I think there is something for everyone here, as this is not a subject that is covered much. Not sure if this was/is PBS but it could almost be. Oh and if you want to relax this is great. No excitement but interesting enough that it will not put you to sleep."
1,Wonderful simple ideas for little ones.
1,So many people had told me to watch this series because of how relevant it is to what is happening now in Baltimore.  The program is so well done and such an eye-opener.  It is not easy to take at times.  Lot's of violence and heartbreak.
1,This has many stories which would be good movies on their own.
1,Sneaky Pete is a lot sneaker then one thinks. The end promises a bright future for this series. Good job a Amazon!!
1,I loved Urgo and window of oppurtunity
1,Entertaining
1,This dramatization of the recent and continuing security situation in Mali gives us a very helpful sense of what life must be like in a traditionally-Muslim area that is taken over by an ISIS-related group.
1,Eh it's okay. An original idea... I just didn't really like the idea lol it was not scary
1,Slow at times
1,Love this movie!! Absolute classic!!
1,Great show
1,Quality show.
1,aweosme!!!!! love dark hispanic superman!
0,slow and boring movie...
1,"Meh so far; will update as I get further along, if I can...."
1,"very engaging, pulls you in, and Matthew McConaughey is excellent in the role of grieving father~"
1,Awesome show
1,"Worth watching. However, doesn't really deliver on most of the plot points. It's like...you haven't eaten pizza in like 3 months....then you finally get to eat pizza....and it's average and you are alright with it...but you kind of wish you had eat pizza somewhere else."
1,Very interesting show
1,Fantastic series. Looking forward to the next season!
1,Enjoyed this film very much....although I think its definitely more of a girls film!
1,"They don't make movies this good any more. Excellent, I highly recommend it."
1,Loved it.  Hoping season 5 comes on free soon
1,tatiana is so hot.. and with all the characters she portrays adds to the excitement.. totally intense drama!!
1,what a amazing ending!!that's all i want about these twoï¼Œthanks Bryan Fuller
1,"My father in law showed me a video of Jeff Daniels talking about how America has changed on Facebook, and it comes to find out that it is the beginning of episode #1 of season #1 for the newsroom.<br /><br />After I found this out, I am glued to an episode almost every night.<br /><br />The characters are like-able and interesting and the stories are well written.<br /><br />Amazon Prime never ceases to maze me with the amount of good shows it offers!"
1,A simple kind of entertainment! Feel good stories!
1,Loved it!
1,Reall a great movie
1,Great second part. Would recommend
1,love that clay
1,"I really loved this movie. I watched it with my 5 year old daughter and 15 year old son. They both enjoyed it. It isn't a kid's movie though. There is violence. But I loved the story line. It was interesting, engaging, and memorable."
1,Better than the previous seasons.
1,Fantastic!!!
1,I liked that it completed the loose ends of some of the stories in the series.
1,Enjoyed very much
1,I just like AB ; )
1,Great movie.
1,It's not what I thought the movie would be.  It kind of drag on. Nice average story line.
1,"Very good quality, loved all the episodes."
1,"Here's another &#34;oldie-goldie&#34; that leaves you lingering in thought of those character traits that inspire rather than discourage.  People of noble-character demonstrating: civility even in rebellion, dignity vs uncouth, selfless love despite loss, and generosity over personal gain to help foreigners attain better lives.  These types of movies promote the best in humans .... something to aspire to.  It left you pondering the good in people.  I liked it"
1,"didn't get to finish it, kinda drawn out."
1,"So this film definitely isn't for everybody, but if you're tired of formulaic hollywood &#34;indie&#34; films and want something dry, weird, and lo-fi, this is solid gold. It's funny in a dark, deadpan way, with a nihilistic vibe and a little bit of violence. Overall, this is the most original indie film I've seen in several years."
0,"What can you say, it's The Shining"
1,Story line well used. Nice escape from burdens of everyday.  Wishing I could be there and taste the pudding!
0,"DO NOT BE DECEIVED. THIS IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE. 90% of the film consisted of an expressionless Ryan Gosling gazing at....stuff. As for his other scenes, I envision a scenario in which the director instructed Gosling to express the absolute least amount of emotion possible in every single scene. It appears to be a film meant to impress people who make films rather than for people who enjoy them. Watching this film was PAINFULLY, PAINFULLY BORING. That this film is boring cannot be emphasized enough."
1,Awesome!
1,"Very touching, great score, modern day Oliver Twist with music."
1,David is the best qwerky comic ever.
1,Favorite show!
1,Great series - great characters
1,Great storyline and acting!
1,One of the best series to come along in a long time!
1,Not bad.
1,Dumb but fun.
1,Very exciting season
1,Acting is excellent politics is liberal
1,"I was hooked.  Couldn't put it down just HAD to watch &#34;just one more&#34;!  Felt they brought me into the other side of these characters.  They weren't just thugs, they had reasons behind their behavior.  Gave me a different perspective that left me wanting more.  Will be waiting for the next season to go Prime."
1,"What an amazing story... Very insightful. It encourages me to do more! Now, I just need a hug."
1,Great lessons for young girls - highly recommend - very well done
1,different ending than I expected
1,Great start to season 3.
0,Bad movie
1,Love it!
1,very interesting movie..... I enjoyed it.
1,Excellent Film!
1,My kids love this show and more seasons just mean more fun I see them pretending.
1,Interesting story
1,Good show
1,My daughter loves to watch Blue's Clues. She even asked for a notebook and crayon so that she could write down her own clues. It teaches you to pay attention and think about the things you see around you.
1,They did a good job on selecting actors for the parts.  It has the same quality as the rest of the trek movies
1,"I've used this phrase before, but this movie was a &#34;fun ride&#34;.  It does a good job of staying light and not taking itself too seriously while still serving up good action scenes.  Understand that this movie is about the &#34;legend&#34; of Hercules and how it was used by this team of adventurers."
1,This has shown how different a mindset is from what we have usually.
1,My 10-year old said it was so-so.
1,Really miss this show. Was a huge mistake taking it off the air.
1,Enjoy the action and mix of characters.
0,"I watched the first episode with great anticipation. Unfortunately I was so distracted by the poor quality of the subtitles that I will not continue for the rest of the series. There is so much available for home screen viewing that producers should take care with the subtitles on foreign series. I am sorry because the series is interesting and has received some attention from critics, The viewer might give it a try. Your patience might surpass mine."
1,Simply the best show ever!!!
1,"I grew up with this show, and still enjoy re-watching it."
1,Interesting true story
1,Best shark movie ever
1,Very good
1,Every season is fun to watch and it's great to be able to see previous seasons.  It doesn't matter which one you watch as the ending is always a mystery.
1,Beyond great
1,Watched this movie many times over the years. Definitely one the better movies in the Eastwood canon. Malkovich plays the villain superbly.<br />Lots and lots of great character actors fill support roles that just make this movie good.
1,Love all episodes!
0,"In the final episode a character who is dying reveals the answer to the central mystery of the plot.  The combination of his labored breathing, raspy voice, and poor quality audio made his statements unintelligible.  I listened  to the segment three times using several volume levels and high quality headphones and never got  it."
1,It is a comedy so plays a bit to the stereotypical politician.  Some good humor and a few good laughs.  But the interesting thing to me is how accurately it portrays a few of the shallower types I have met in this business having been involved off and on interacting with my State government political types.  In some cases it is spot on which should be a scary thing to those that are not involved up close with them.
1,not bad I like it
1,Great action from beginning to the end.. Keeps your mind moving..
1,Love it
1,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that WCTH was just a little &#34;slicker&#34; for season 2... but what a great show! Solid family values and good storylines. It's my daughter and my favorite show right now, and we're watching and rewatching, eager for season 3."
1,"Only 4 because it wasn't Live. Lame I know should be 5, but live music hides some of the singers mistakes. I try to always give 5, however this time I could not bring myself to do it. If I was there it would be a 10. Very enjoyable peace and it is almost that time a year for a live performance. Enjoy"
1,OMG! Not what I expected ...It was better than expected.
0,Not as good as the first.
1,"Only watched first episode so far, It was okay . I know they have to get the basic story, characters & plot started. So we'll see how it goes from here."
1,An okay movie.  Predictable but still entertaining.
1,Very cool
1,I loved this show. Intelligent and entertaining.
1,"A very intriguing idea realized in a first rate television production. Metaphorically an anti-racist and anti-fascist tale, it keeps one more than simply interested with well written scripts, compelling acting (especially Ms. Berry) and a level of creative development not often seen on T.V. Highly recommended."
1,Loved it!  A hilarious mockumentary from the creators of Flight of the Concords.  A humorous look at the &#34;real&#34; lives of vampires.
1,Perfect
1,Really good great music
1,"Bill Nighy is just so darn good! He's unique. Let him mix with spectacular folks like Rachel Weisz and Christopher Walken, and watch what happens. The writing is so good; the acting is the action."
0,Not intetesting enough to hold my attention
1,great cast and funny!!! Very British hum
1,Good British made ghost story.
1,Loved the action and the twists and turns
1,"Three and a half really, very well acted. Interesting perspective on what it is to live in the absence of emotion. The bond of ice melts away."
1,Clever story lines. Great cast. LD is the best.
1,Great show
1,Really enjoyed the season. They get better each year.
1,Great series
1,"Fabulous!  I watch it with my 11-year-old daughter.  We are hooked.  It is so sweet.  We binge watched it while binge eating junk food.  I'm sad that it's done.  Please make more!  We love the Zane character.  More, please!"
1,Loves
1,Just ok entertainment.
1,Engaging movie
1,I absolutely love this show and can't wait to try the restaurant.
1,The best season of Spongebob. I miss the old days and the creativity of Hillenburg and his original crew.
1,Awesome show
1,Can't stop binge-watching this incredible series!
1,Mediocre
1,Classic from my childhood never gets old
1,Intriguing!
1,Loved it
1,"Good quality version of the film. The music is a bit odd, but it is not distracting. This film is a great example of German expressionism. The story is very cool too. If you are a film nut, this is a must."
1,Great family movie!
1,"Sure is different! Death isn't usually a laughing matter, but this show manages somehow to present a lighter side of death. It's a pretty old series, but still worth watching."
1,My son loves this season.  He loves all of them but I think the change of having a new format for the show helped him enjoy the puppet version of the show too.
1,Outstanding. Great show to binge on.
1,Leaves me wanting more.....love it!
1,Enjoyable family movie. Entertaining for adults as well.
1,All Eastwood movies are good. What't not to like?
1,Love this show.  Thanks for offering it!!!
1,"Great show, very funny!"
1,"I enjoyed the way the season played out, kept me watching, instead of bored.  Enjoyed it!"
1,"Nice pace, not very realistic, but have a great and meaningful punchline!"
1,Show is great but there have been intermittent STREAMING issues.  that is an AMAZON thing.
1,It seems very scripted and fake but even so it was fun and entertaining to watch. I hope they make a season 2.
1,Action packed with an excellent story line. Love the show!
1,True tale.
1,Love this movie. Melanie Griffith is a favorite and her performance here is stellar.
1,Good series for being so old
1,"Silly, funny, touching. Dudley Moore is over the top in the title role. Sir John Gielgud is delightfully droll as Hobson."
0,"Do not get me wrong, I loved Seinfeld, which is a whole television series about nothing.  However that was interesting and funny.  This was slow, boring and like a broken pencil, pointless."
1,This is my go to show! I love it so much!!
1,Love Love LOVE this show!!! I can't wait for more!
1,My 7year old daughter watched this nonstop for a month.
1,Asorbing series!
1,I have thoroughly been enjoying this show.  I watch it while on the cardio machines and the gym and it really helps to pass the oh so painfully boring activity!  I find myself looking forward to the next workout so that I can continue with this show.
1,"EARLY PLOT SPOILER<br /><br />The best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?"
1,Absolutely loved it! Veronica Mars fan for life!
1,Very funny show. Type of show you would like would be just awful but it works for some reason.
1,Thank you for your service and sacrifice you have made for my freedom.
1,Please make more!!!
1,"We enjoyed the 1st season of CATASTROPHE very much. At times it was a little hard to catch several  of the fast spoken UK idioms, which called for a bit of rewinding, but overall the cast is engaging and very funny without being too sweet. Yet one can see the potential for a very loving relationship growing, and a great many laughs to come as this bumbling couple become parents.<br />We hope the show continues to run, looking forward to Season 2."
1,Great plot and story continuation. Refreshing and believable characters. Awesome special effects. Excellent download quality.
1,The movie was a true depiction of the life and times of the era.
1,Wonderful series! Great Actors! Great Story! A fascinating look to a orthodox religious community in Jerusalem.
1,Too much unnecessary profanity - otherwise all ages could have enjoyed.
0,"Lots of special effects, not much story."
1,"his video is very instructive, There is nothing like it. For the dancer, it is essential and great to hear Suki and Merrill talk about instruction that Balanchine had given them as dancers, Suki is delightful although her French accent can be hard to understand as she rattles ballet terms. The moves are also demonstrated by students who later became company dancers. For the ballet aficionado like myself, these tapes have provided me with a wealth of information about jumps that I failed to get from books. In the two volumes, the jumps are divided into five sections: one foot to one foot, one foot to two feet, two feet to one foot, etc. I saw Meryl dance (always wonderfully) many times and it is a treat to see her demonstrate that technique that made her in her time an unequally fast dancer. Definitely 5 stars and if I could I would give Merrill and Suki many hugs."
1,Loved it
1,It was okay.
1,"Interesting use of huge talent. So far just five very well acted characters, each given funny dialogue. Not for everyone, but I'm such a fan of both Ian McMullen and Derek Jacobi and this does not disappoint."
1,"Excellent production value, terrific sets.  Execution and casting a bit off in my opinion, but a great effort and a welcome return of live musical broadcasts."
1,Awesome
1,Awesome show! Creative thinking :)
1,Interesting adaptation of the Stephen King novel. Jack Nicholson was superb!
1,"It's just really funny, even the cringe-worthy moments. The Larry David character is both likable and absurd at the same time."
1,5 nuff-said
1,Very well done documentary.
1,My daughter loves it. I like it because it focuses on diversity and doing what is right. Everyone can be different.
1,A very good plot with many twist and turns.
1,"Great find....quirky comedy that hits home.  We watched Season 1 (6 episodes, 30 minutes each) in 2 nights.  Looking forward to season 2."
1,I love this show even if I've seen most episodes years ago.  Melinda does show too much skin but producers seem to think that is what sells it seems.  I like the way she helps spirits resolve their problems so they can cross over.  It would be nice to be able to give people left behind a wake up call that the possibility of ghosts is maybe what they need to find closure.  This may be one of the first shows that has enough entertainment and not just selling a product out there.  I really like being able to view the episodes without annoying commercial ads blasting my ear drums.
1,Love Terra and all the firecrackers on this show!!!
1,Awesome alien action.
1,Great heartwarming movie
1,great!
1,Boring

1,"Great!!  Disappointed that season 5 is not on Prime yet, though."
1,"Excellent, although do not understand why its under Science maybe behavioral."
1,"Great fast paced, smart dialogue."
1,"It kept me very entertained, it was nice to watch something that didn't have too many sexual scenes."

0,No solid product or conclusions.
0,"Season 1 showed promise. Season 2 quickly devolved into bad writing, and foolishness. I stopped watching after the first episode of season 1."
0,"This was a disappointing movie.  The actor playing the maid was attractive and sympathetic but the crucial moment in her relationship with the young boy was very unconvincing, whether it was the fault of the direction or the script, I am not sure.  The young lead actor was just bad.  Again, it may have been the fault of the script but he was very unsympathetic.  It was very hard to see what the maid could possibly see in such a obnoxious teen-ager."
1,"I loved this movie!  I thought the character development was great, and it kept me totally entertained."
1,"Still a very interesting series, but changes to the cast and some of the story lines diminish the strength of the series."
1,I am enjoying the show.
1,interesting story line
1,Ok
1,Really enjoyed this star-packed show.  Bill Nighy was excellent.
1,"Loved it, can't wait to be done with season 4!"
0,The animation was good.
1,I cried through the whole movie and could not stop watching.  Loved it.
1,"very, very good."
1,Meh
1,Super cute.  Loved being able to share this with grandchildren.
0,What I thought might be a thought provoking drama turned out to be a bit of religious propaganda with very shallow and unrealistic characters.  I can't recommend it to serious viewers.
1,Amazing show.  Fun for the whole family.
1,Kids loved it
1,"Engrossing series, I couldn't wait to see what her next move might be!"
1,Even better than Band of Brothers if that is possible
1,I loved this show and wished it would have gone onto other seasons. They would have never ran out of material to write.
1,"This is charming and quietly amusing -- not often laugh-out-loud funny, but anything directed by Christopher Guest and starring Chris O'Dowd is worth watching.  Look for lots of Guest regulars in smaller roles. I found the sister with the monkey puppet and the obnoxious best friend to be annoying characters who detract from the story, so knocked off a star for that."
1,"Love the actors, love to story line.  Love  LOve  LOVE IT."
1,Love thes series and this season too
1,"When they thought the world was flat, a Greek fisherman takes a Princess back to Atlantis which is on the verge of attacking the rest of the world with their superior weapons.  But corruption abounds in Atlantis, and that continent is on the verge of extinction.  The fisherman falls in love with the Atlantis Princess and is determined to save her from Atlantis' destruction... The film is dated, but enjoyable entertainment if you extend your imagination.  It's a pleasant, enjoyable film."
1,5 stars
1,Good show for geeks
1,"One of the best show I have seen!!! It's informative, bold and expertly directed. It had a finominal cast! Too bad it stopped with season 3...would have lived to see more.."
1,I can't believe I never heard about this TV series before buying Amazon Prime.  It is &#34;addictive&#34; and I'm delighted I can watch all the episodes consecutively without having to wait week to week during the regular season.  Viewing this show was worth the price of buying Amazon Prime this spring!  Keeps viewers guessing and I love all the legal maneuvers and suspense of what the outcomes will be!
1,awsome sauce!
1,great series
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
1,This was a pretty decent movie
1,A great documentary which was respectful of both God and science...what a rarity! I loved it.
1,Very interesting and atentions grabing
0,I find it uncomfortable to watch...she goes to seemingly normal to wacked out.
1,Outstanding real life covert situations.
1,loved it
0,I watched it til I couldn't.  There are some real nice cars & good driving in the movie. That's all I can say about it.<br />I'm not sure what audience this was intended for.<br />I give it 2 stars & that's what it deserves..
0,Just so and so
0,Very depressing!
1,very well done lots of fun
1,"Good family film. It demonstrates responsibility, courage and regard for others inspite of the odds."
1,Awesome!!
1,"Slow moving movie, but worth watching for both Bruce Derns and the actress playing his wife performances"
1,Archer is a very amusing and funny animated TV show.
1,Excellent movie. Tom Hanks was outstanding.
1,If you like Terry Gilliam then ...
1,loved it!!!
0,"May be the humor in this flick is suited more for the younger generation.  I never picked up on it.  Couldn't get through the first half, and I hate paying and not watching the whole thing."
1,love it
1,Very different.  Nice change of pace movie
1,Didn't know anything about Sriracha until this show. Must watch.
1,"If you like action adventure non stop, this is the movie for you. I thought it was better than<br />the first and seaond."
1,I love this one too...I will re-watch it again too. So enjoyable and very informative too.
0,Pile on the CHEESE !
1,Great movie<br />Some parts little graphic for non teenagers
1,It was watchable but not great or memorable.  The acting was fairly decent.  Anne Heche's character was peculiar.  I think the movie failed in that once again the characters weren't sympathetic enough.  The ending should have been more of a surprise but it was predictable because the character wasn't likable enough.  Movies these days definitely need to work on character development.
1,"It reminds me of when there was news on newscasts. The acting is excellent, as is the story line. I am looking forward to watching season two."
1,"Very exciting, sexy and enjoyable. A little like Homeland with an English twist."
1,I love these Cuban people. Talk about a resourceful and helpful community! I love to see the culture and their resourcefulness. I mean... one guy has a diesel BOAT MOTOR in his car... whaaaaat??? No bumper? No problem! I'll just MAKE MY OWN. These guys are great.
1,"Dynamite period piece layered with more than corsets and crinolines. Issues of race, family relationships, the position/s of women, and legalities verses moral integrities in the 18th century unfold organically and are confronted by authentic textured characters who are based in fact.<br />Society and historical context are displayed within the confines of a tightly written script, beautifully realized by artistic technical collaboration, headed by a director of imaginative vision, passionate loving heart, and a deft guiiding hand.<br />What's portrayed in this film is only one of the specific worlds that benefited and thrived during the long world history of black enslavement. It is a pretty world, for those on top of course, and we are not really shown &#34;slavery&#34; as experienced in another recent film dealing with a similar theme, Twelve Years A Slave. The sweep of Belle offers the audience a different tone, wider issues.  It's view of slavery is just as horrific as slavery is in Twelve Years A Slave, but its particular and also very specific points are made in quieter ways--at least for this viewer.<br />Both films hit home and are most satisfying, in their own good and different ways.<br />It's great to see a black woman leading a period piece, too.<br />Belle is a beautiful film and is one that I will watch again."
1,1st season is better but 2nd holds your interest. Not finished yet but will continue to watch it. Maslany is terrific.
1,"FAIR PRODUCTION,"
1,Love it
0,"The cast seemed way too old to me. Why are all of these 30-year-olds still in high school? Aside from that, it was a touchy-feely film that tried way too hard to relate to today's high school students. The moral of the story is that you'll always be better off just being a nice person. The message was too simple to justify a 45 minute story. A younger audience might not see the flaws and be entertained by the premise."
1,Great!!!
1,good movie
1,Loved it!
1,Great show! Ragnar is an awesome character.
1,Excellent
1,Terrific!
1,Tear jerker
1,Classic
1,I'd still give it 5 stars but the changed a few things from seasons 1 and 2. First they changed the opening theme song. Same song onkyorenupbeat which totally throws me off. Secondly the change the story a bit to be a season long story. In some ways it was great but it also limited their direction. They had still had diversion stories and they did it very well. It was just no longer a week to week toss up. I'm in the middle of watching it for the 2nd time and still think it is awesome. They have more syncs to their characters which didn't need to happen but did make it even more interesting.
1,Fun for children and adults!
1,Always entertaining no matter how many times we watched it
1,granddaughter love this
1,"Enjoyable, off beat show"
1,The classic show. Groundbreaking at the time and now better remastered.
1,Great show!
1,I love this series!  I am only disappointed that in order to watch the third season one must pay for each episode.  Call me tight....I just don't understand!
1,great old movie
1,a lot of action
1,Great!  I like how it streamed one episode after the other without stopping.
1,I love this show
1,Great love story
1,Great acting. Awesome storyline
1,Awesome
1,I just purchased season 1 because I'm an Omari Hardwick fan.  Since he's no longer on the show I will no longer watch...but what I saw was cool.
1,My 2 year old loves Thomas and this movie in particular.
1,Great entertaining show.
1,Great movie...
1,"Adeline touches your heart and then steals it away by the end of the movie. Great acting, great script, and without a doubt a memorable romantic journey through time."
1,good acting.  strange interesting plot
1,Great movie. Didn't see that coming.
1,A must watch. So good
1,"Whoa, sorry I judged it before I saw it! This is Heavy Duty.....no pulled punches!!!! HZ"
1,Excellent movie!
1,Touching and poignant.
0,Loved the books. Like the characters but movie dropped me at an unexpected spot. Felt like it could have ended in a better spot.
1,Love it.
0,"I could maybe give it a 4 or 5 stars, if I was able to watch it on my Fire TV Stick,  but since it never worked from day one,  about 3 months ago,  ZERO stars would be more appropriate..."
0,The movie was horrible
1,I was hooked from the Pilot episode.... A thoroughly entertaining show with awesome characters!
1,Really loved it
0,"I can only imagine that Kate Winslet was begging the screen writers, &#34;Please.  For all that is holy.  Kill me in this movie.  Don't make me come back for the third film.&#34;"
1,Love this movie and I really will miss seeing more of Robin William's amazing talent in the future.
1,Hilarious!!!
0,Hokie
1,excellent series.  we completely enjoy it
1,good Movie
1,"Loved Loved this movie!, It's so good!"
1,"Loved this documentary! Very informative and encouraging for everyone but especially moms who are interested in breastfeeding. It also discusses the bonding with mother and baby, which also influences breastfeeding."
1,Strong and beautiful series.
1,Best action movie in decades.
1,"I watched this instead of doing my work.  Even when my boss passed by my desk and I had to turn off the sound, I could tell the dialogue was fresh and extremely funny.  Sharon Horgan gives great face!  Rob Delaney is very likable in this role, if you can believe that! Loved every episode...however, the episodes with Tobias Menzies as the obgyn are tops!  Wish there were more to watch in this series.  Hopefully, series 2 will be on Amazon Prime soon after its release in the UK."
1,"Great show, waiting for season 2."
1,Cute  show.
1,Interesting look at a political presidential campaign without maligning the office or Sen. John MacCain.
1,My son loves Thomas
1,I thought I would be able to watch this on my system or burn it but not so!!!  Save yourself the trouble and buy the DVD.
1,Kids love this one
1,Excellent.
1,"Great actors, but too bizarre for me.  Difficult trying to keep up with story line. I can see why it only made it one season."
0,They introduced characters and plot lines and just dropped them.  Characters acted out of character.  All said a Hot Mess.  After watching two good seasons I stayed with it through this mess.
1,Really good movie!
1,Very good.  Especially if you have ever lived or visited New Orleans.  Or if you have ever been to Mardi Gras.
1,Season 2 Episode 12 - The best one yet! So much excitement and heart!
1,A really great movie to watch. Very impressive
1,"This series is based upon the memoirs of a woman who served as a midwife in the East side of London in the 1950's.  It shows the dedication of people trying to revive their country after WWII.  There are funny moments, tender moments and poignant moments all mixed together in an exquisite blend."
1,Great show.
1,Dying to see it
1,"Hayden Christensen plays a total jerk who wakes up one day to find that nearly everyone in the world has vanished, and the days grow shorter and the nights increasingly longer. Worse yet, the shadows are alive and are trying kill everyone. On paper, Vanishing on 7th Street sounds like a sure fire win for a horror movie. It plays on the natural fear of the dark many people have, has plenty of mystery that keeps you engaged, and it has a fairly solid cast with the likes of Christensen (who shouldn't be judged by the poor script he had in the Star Wars prequels), Thandie Newton, and John Leguizamo.<br /><br />Sadly, while the film does have some decent scares and manages to maintain some level of tension. It never fully achieves the potential it sets itself up for. Between hokey CGI shadow effects, hackneyed usage of true historical mysteries with easy explanations that blow the film's supposed explanation out of the water, and truly stupid character decisions the film feels more like a bad Doctor Who episode (and given that show actually had an episode about killer shadows that was AMAZING makes this film look all the more worse). Add onto that, a truly stupid ending with obvious biblical undertones and a shot that rips off the iconic image of The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes riding his horse down an abandoned highway and you have the mediocre strawberry on a truly disappointing cake.<br /><br />Not to mention, it's way too easy to make &#34;Dark side of the force&#34; jokes throughout the entire film's run time. I strongly recommend watching this movie with your friends and seeing who can come up with the best Dark Side pun."
1,I enjoyed season two and am looking forward to watching season three.
1,great series
0,Austin and the twins are annoying and it ruins the show..
1,brooklyn dodgers  you need more the espn series also
1,Exciting.
1,Nice must here
1,"I loved the Riches, just sorry it petered out. Seems like lots of material to write about."
1,Great program!
1,"Entertaining, gripping and real. The writers don't need to flash flesh to get and keep your attention. The family meals are my favorite parts."
0,the writers thought the F word should be used often regardless of the subject of the scene.
1,I will always love this show
1,great acting
1,This was an excellent drama that had a lot of moving parts. The lead actor for the show was cast perfectly for the role and I hope there will be a follow up season.
1,Great presentation of even a better book.
1,it was ok
1,I am a Stephen King fan so of course I love this series!
1,An Easter Classic!
1,Great show! Wish it was still on the air!
1,Fabulous!
1,thtehethteht
1,good
1,All time classic.
0,"Ridiculous story -- If you watch it for the baseball part you will be disappointed.  If you watch it for the romance you will be disappointed, if, however, you want to watch a story about how poor black people can only succeed with the help of good looking young white people then I guess you might enjoy it.<br /><br />The child actors are the best part of this movie (and they don't get nearly the screen time they should)"
1,Love it
1,"Excellent in every aspect. The writing, actors, story, a solid 10 across the board"
1,Outstanding love the show
1,Great documentary...
1,A classic that kids should get to watch
1,"This movie is far too cerebral for many... but if you are capable of deep meaning and accepting of unresolved feelings of wonder, this would be a good watch.<br />I enjoyed it."
1,"Thoughtful plot with an interesting, though disturbing, ending."
1,Nice action spy program.  A little far fetched but still within the believability window.
0,"I thought this movie would be similar in plot to the movie ' Set-Up ' starring Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah. Not even close! it was straight-up nonsense! It was nothing more than a chance for the girls to show some skin, and for James Franco to play pretend gangsta in a exaggerated and comical manner. What a waste of my time. Oh, did I also mention that it sucks? No? Well it does, big time!"
1,"Not John Wayne at his best, but still John Wayne."
1,Love the show
1,nothing real exciting in this movie.
1,Enjoyed it very much.
1,"I loved the storyline however the plot took too long to unfold.  For me the connection between the final confrontation and rescue of Cass was weak. Too much rested on the credibility of her father Matthew.  Until the detective, Jeffery, decided to put aside his personal feeling and pursue a lead provided him by Matthew the victims in the film did not stand a chance."
1,Nice Movie. Must see
1,This is a good movie
0,"Started off good, but once you find out what the spooks are, it's all downhill. The movie is all setup, and no payoff--but with a really hokey ending."
1,"Good acting, Great Special Effects, and above average plot, and fun to watch"
1,See how the other half live. Takes you back to a simpler much harder times.
1,Yum
0,I did not connect with any of the characters and the story line dragged. Boring.
1,My kids love this show.
1,Great standup
1,Wow! Definitely worth a whole season. Need to know how this one will end!!!!
1,"I watched this originally to give my toddler a chance to watch something that didn't make me cringe- we all ended up loving it, saying &#34;Wow, I never knew that&#34; and &#34;That's so cool!&#34;. It's a little short attention span encouraging with it's fast & brief clips, but it's far from the worst I've seen."
1,Really enjoy this show.
1,"cool movie, would watch again."
1,The individual episodes can vary in quality but I like the premise and some shows are very good. Sometimes I would like to see other branches of a family tree pursued as well as the primary focus of the show. Worth a sequel maybe?
1,I should have realized that the primary intended audience is those under 40 or so.  My three stars is an evaluation for and by a senior citizen.
1,One Of The Best!
1,"love to watch this with my grandchildren.  The lessons, the visuals and the sounds are all perfect."
1,TOO BAD this show was not given a chance to stay on TV.  It was cancelled after only one season.  Kim Delaney and the other actors of this show were very interesting and their story lines were a bit quirky but very interesting.  I watched it when it first debuted but after the season ended the show was cancelled.
1,It was nice to see Rob pretend to not be a virgin.
1,This is a feel good show.
1,"Very family friendly, entertaining for all"
1,Good movie
0,Didn't like.
1,Creative writing...lots of surprises...good characters.
1,"being a Clevelander, this is very interesting!"
1,"Well done, thought provoking look at Artificial Intelligence. Excellent performances,especially Oscar Issac."
1,My grand daughter loves this movie.  She watches it over and over again.
1,Dinesh D'Souza clarifies the deceptive nature of Obama by bringing to light Obama's need for self-aggrandizement.
1,Took a while to start watching but once i did I was hooked. All I can think is --is there more ? If so i want it.
1,I loved it and how the suspense pulled me in deeper as the story unfolded.  Also knowing that this can really happen made it an even better movie.
1,Great-<br />Kid loves it.
0,"As a Christian, I found the movie morally offensive at the outset; did not watch past the first few minutes."
1,"My 6 yr. old son absolutely loves this show. He loves it more than any other show we'very watched, and we have watched many other PBS shows. I highly recommend this one because it teaches some excellent mathematical concepts."
1,Maybe it's because I'm a History major but I absolutely loved this series. I loved it so much that I will watch it again to get details I may have missed on my initial viewing.
1,"I didn't think I would like this series but, I am loving it! It's funny and has a great storyline."
1,Pure awesomeness
1,Still funny.
0,I tried to get through this twice. It's just awful.
1,Great Program!
1,"Beautiful setting, great story lines, top talents, addictive"
0,"I am not sure about this as I started watching and am not compelled to get back to it, which I think may say it all.  Still at some time I may try it again."
1,Awesome!!
1,"Touching, funny, movinh"
0,Boring with very little humor.
0,To much nasty talk
1,Good...not great.
1,Excellent movie in about every category.  And as true to legend as the King Arthur story gets.  Details and events are argumentative but the gist of the story is as true as the legend gets.  The acting and the scenes are realistic and don't appear contrived.  I have seen the movies several times and get a little more out of it each time viewed.  I'd recommend it to anyone and any age.......
1,Loved it
1,"This film has non-stop exciting action and all sorts of improbable but enjoyable situations. I felt that one regular cast member who has grown along with the rest of the cast as the series has evolved was dispensed with too readily, but otherwise a great film, outstanding cast, excellent cinematography and direction. This will definitely please fans of the Fast and Furious franchise and the hot rod, speed movie genre. This film has lots of fun and excitement and is OK for families with older kids to watch. There is no profanity that I can recall but lots of violence, although it has an ethereal quality. This is the most durable, bulletproof family of hot-rodders you will ever meet. Spellbinding special effects and touching tribute to the late Paul Walker, a talented artist who left us much too soon. Filmmaking gold."
1,same ho hum stuff
1,Great series
1,Good movie
1,Great movie
1,"Great movie. Shows once again that all that separates us is bad ideology that often gets in our brains through indoctrination. Once those false beliefs are removed, we see humans in one other again."
1,"Love Raylan, gonna miss him.ðŸ˜‰"
1,Classic movie
1,A very good movie. Will watch it again.
1,Awesome series. Can't wait for Season 2.
1,Fast paced and funny
1,Great classic
1,"Insight into the battles, uniforms and accuracy of the film Zulu. The background music was so loud it's hard to hear the commentary."
1,Good acting.  Multiple character visitations distracting
1,Good show
1,"Very impressed by this series in all respects -- concept, writing, directing, acting, design are all first rate. Most impressive is how fast we became hooked. By 7 minutes into episode 1, we wanted to watch episode 2. Ended up watching all of season 1 in one evening. Now what?"
1,Best show in any timeline or dimension.
1,"Great show, very close to real life"
1,Cannot wait for season 4 to wrapit up and see the human's defeat the obvious no-gooders from somewhere.
0,Horrible!  Just plain horrible!!
1,Addicting!
1,"Classic movie for the whole family, with amazing music. My kids(7, 5, 2) loved this movie because of the animals."
1,"Very interesting story; complex characters, but definitely adult themes, not for those under 16 or so. Many twists in plotline, but requires so much suspension of belief as seasons continue. Full of unhealthy relationships; however does explore the complexity of human nature and how good but warped we can also be."
1,One of the funniest shows I've seen. Amazon needs to renew for a second season and bring them cast back.
1,"Although some are these are repeat views, they're just as funny as the first time. After viewing 4 seasons, I see a lot of the Seinfield &#34;show about nothing&#34; ideas here too. Larry has a black-cloud following him everywhere but his mouth is usually the culprit that keeps him in trouble. Great and funny series!"
1,My favorite sifi show ever
0,"Too much Psuedo-science, weak plot."
1,This was a fun movie with great acting and a heartwarming story. Great interaction between the main characters who are husband and wife in real life.
1,I loved this show as a kid. Now my kids are enjoying it. It's a classic.
1,Great mystery drama. Slow roles for easy enjoyable watching.
1,Great.  Very entertaining
1,Great movie! I bought this for my grandkids so they can watch it anytime they want. They take with them when they go on a road trip!
1,I can't stopping watching this moving. A true tragic love story with a beautiful melody.
0,not so good
1,"It's a really good movie.  Some how I missed it in 2014, so it was new to me.  And I enjoyed it.  Good story.  Good cast.  Good direction,  And the film has a great look.  Recommended."
1,Well done
1,It was an enjoyable experience considering it's short length
1,Great show
1,"A true classic of the horror genre.  There may be a scene or two that some people will think are a little dated, but the performances carry it through. Truly well done."
1,My kids love it ..
1,it was ok
1,"I like the twist on the Hercules story, by letting the family and friends play a key role in his success! Also that he had doubts about himself and his abilities making the character more relatable."
1,Great show
1,Love it!
1,Love this series!
1,Very good movie ))
1,"A terrific series with a cast full of well-developed characters.  Plus, I've never seen so many famous guest appearances in one show.  They parade the A-lister actors in and out of different episodes which, of course, the show's format allows since they're always fighting a battle in court, good-guy vs. bad guy.  What startles me the most (SPOILER ALERT!) is why they would remove one of the headliners...?  We'll see how that balance develops, but overall, it's a good show with enough action and intelligence to keep you glued."
1,funny!
1,Daughter loves it!
1,Funny and entertaining without any smut.
1,Best of the best!
1,We really enjoyed to first episode. We hope to see more.
1,Didnt disappoint!
1,excellent show with great cast and story line
1,"Keep me interested, good acting."
1,Will it continue?
1,Good movie
0,Could barley get through it. No story line just a lot of naked people. Great writing (think Breaking Bad) doesn't need nudity.
1,Continuing in form and still entertaining.
1,It was ok.  Not the best action/thriller I've been for it works.
1,Love this show!
1,Our kids enjoy Thomas. This  movie was no different -- bringing MUCH joy and laughter.
0,did not like it
1,great accting
1,Almost done with the first season. I have heard nothing but great reviews about this show and Iam glad that it lives up to its hype!
1,Funny at times and action is OK.
1,Loved the show. Seemed like it took half the movie for the boys to get their mojo back.
0,"good acting, but story line was too rough for my tastes, we didnt finish it."
1,Excellent
1,Loved it!  Bring on more please.
1,Hilarious and fun
1,love the characters.
1,Now this is a good movie. Better than the first one and also megan Fox
0,SLOW !!!!  The characters are intriguing and catch your interest. Want to find out what happens to them so watch when nothing else to watch. In the middle of second season.
1,"My son, who was three when the original movie came out, Love it! Not like the original but he wants it on DVD"
1,Good film... Great twist!
1,Funny
1,"Better than Bates Hotel, and so much more gruesome and demented. Hannibal is pure psycho and Will is such an innocent. Great writing!"
1,Great movie!
1,Good movie and overview of Eric's musical evolution...or lack thereof.
1,"I'd like to give this 4 1/2 stars because I more than liked it, but can't say that I loved it. Kate Winslet was wonderful, as usual, as was the male lead. The scenery and costumes are gorgeous. Although I love Stanley Tucci, I felt he was miscast as a French prince. His accent, or lace thereof, jarred me out of the story. Overall though, an excellent movie."
1,"The idea that massive amounts of a vitamin is extremely appealing, but it just can't be that easy. Can it? Would people really kill off hundreds, if not, thousands of people just to make a quick buck? Surely at least most of the people who are in the business of making drugs did it because they wanted to make other's lives better."
1,Another good season.  We enjoy this series.  It's very different from any other show. Quirky main character and actually gives some insight on how to &#34;read&#34; people.
1,love it
0,This would be a great movie to watch IF IT ACTUALLY HAD SUBTITLES!
1,"As much as I like the pretty girls, there's not much else there to draw you back. Casanova is not near as engaging as he thinks he is."
1,"My family is a HUGE fan of Top Gear, so glad Amazon picked up Jeremy and the guys, looking forward to future productions."
1,Okay
1,The HD and stereo version here on my Kindle Fire HD makes this better than ever! Most  enjoyable!
1,My 3 and 5 yr old girls love it!
0,"Terrible, waste of time."
1,"Russell Crowe will always be Maximus Meridius to me and is fun to watch.  The story is just a bit too boring for my taste.  I had it on as background while doing other things, wouldn't watch it again."
1,Great show. Enjoy the reality in a Sci-Fi thriller.
1,Very engaging and great storyline.
1,Best movie ever! Lol
1,We enjoyed this film. Loaded with action as well as comic relief! Would recommend if you liked the first two.
1,"Best show, broh. Good show, broh."
1,My 3 yr old son loves it.
1,What can I say? Tosh is Tosh---not for everyone!
1,Great movie!
1,"interesting characters placed in real life situation, hurricane katrina."
1,"I love Douglas Adams, but this foray into film wasn't done as successfully as I had hoped for. It can be difficult to transition from a book to a movie, and unfortunately this adaptation suffers. They needed to focus more on what the movie needed than what was great in the book. We still enjoyed it, however."
1,I just couldn't stop laughing
1,Excellent
1,Great.  When will Season 3 be available?
1,Awesome movie - great acting and a great story!
0,A terrible movie.  Don't watch it.
1,We like it very much
1,Very Good Story and acting.
1,love the wahlbergs
1,"I love Cox. You watch this movie, and all you can think about is Cox. Cox, Cox and more Cox. . . that's it."
1,Hard to understand fast language but GREAT show
1,This is one of the best written comedies of all time..the cast is great ...the casting of Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce as Frazier and Niles was quite genius..they fit the characters spot on..I am almost done with season one and look forward to watchng the rest of the seasons..truly enjoyable
0,I had to quit watching it because not only was it far fetched but Samuel Jackson lisp was sooo annoying and lame.  His character was weird.
1,Excellent characterization on the law and public services.
1,Excellent if you're in the mood for a classic Western with excellent lead and  villains and  a satisfying ending.
1,"Fine for now, until I have to pay for it"
1,"Suspenseful with ever-changing motives; you're never quite sure who each person is working for until the very end, which is a bit of a suprise in itself.  Definitely worth watching as some of PSH's best work."
1,ðŸ˜
1,Good show. Aliens vs. robots and all the cliches that go with it. What's not to like!
1,"Wow! I was hesitant to watch this at first this series is literally a laugh a minute if you enjoy sarcastic & witty humor!  The characters were real and I feel that many people can completely relate to their situation.  Each episode has the right touch of comedy, sarcasm and reality mixed with a really interesting story.  Can't wait for season 2!!"
1,Good show
1,Offers a unique perspective by combining archaeology and biblical events.  Well written and produced.
1,Loved the glimps into a time period in World War I that I didn't know about. Loved the story!
0,The changes to the storyline are off putting. Now male clones?  Stop while you were ahead. Bashing big corporations and military are tired and boring themes.
1,Great
1,Just some crazy zany fun.
1,Whole family is really enjoying this.
1,Great classic no CGI..excellent.. Yul brynner
1,Love this show!  Happens in life every day!!
1,"Action, suspense, thriller, all wrapped up in each episode, never knowing what to expect. You feel genuine concern for each character.."
1,Light weight but enjoyable
1,A classic that must be seen by anyone who appreciates slap stick comedy with intellect.
1,"Excellent show, even the second time around. The writing is wonderful and actors are still people you care about."
1,Everyone should watch this movie. It should jerk us out of our comfy lives and realize the rest of the world is much different than here.
1,Best show on tv. Tatiana Maslany is amazing.
1,Beautiful music...lovely story !
1,"Don't care for vampire movies, but we decided to watch this one. Cracked us up :)"
1,This show is different from just about everything else on TV? Ithanks has been a refreshing discovery.
1,Worth watching over and over again
1,Great show. Entertaining.
1,"Good show, suspenseful."
1,My kids (ages 10 & 6) can't get enough of Shaun the Sheep!
1,Awsome and touching story.
1,"This was outstanding.  Why I had never seen it before I'll never know, but I am glad I have seen it now.  The musical score is wonderful, so watch it for that if not for the story."
1,Great
1,Story line keeps our interest.  Lack of graphic sex and violence is great - don't need it.  If you have a good story you don't need all the special effects.
1,"Rob Delaney, awesome, hilarious dude. This is kind of awkward and not very funny."
1,Great cop story...love it.
1,Love WWII and history documentaries.  Pretty basic military produced film approach.  Solid and interesting.
0,"It was alright. Passed the time, but nothing spectacular."
1,Good but onle 3 stars
1,"In the far future the system known as the Quad is ruled by the Nine Families and their subsidiary companies that maintain and keep order throughout the worlds.

What they are bounty hunters or &#34;Killjoys&#34; who go after targets wanted for all manner of crimes against the Quad.  SOme are wanted dead, alive it doesn't matter so long as the Killjoys follow the warrant and complete it.  For failure will result in a warrant out for them.

1,Great show!!!! I love the people in this show!!!
1,My son like very much the show. Very educative and I enjoy the show myself with my son.
1,"It was an entertaining movie, good action and better than most of this type."
1,Ok Glimmer Man is better.
1,This is the best series we have seen so far .. absolutely loved it .. wish it would continue.
0,Terrible ending
1,Enjoying this show.
1,Heartwarming.  But I'm not willing to pay $3 per episode to continue watching - sorry!
1,"I enjoyed it, and will watch the next in the series.  However, I give it three stars because the plot is so similar to The Giver.  I'd have to give The Giver three stars for the same reason."
1,The best tv show that I have watched in a long time well done HBO!
1,"It's a shame this was in limited release out in the LA area as this truly showed what a versatile actor Bill Hader is.  Having just seen at the theatre his current release &#34;Train wreck&#34; which his acting was really outstanding I was looking forward to seeing other movies of his and was glad to stumble on &#34;The Skeleton Twins&#34;.  You will be impressed at the story line, the acting of all the major players and will be thinking about this movie long after it is over."
1,"Great story, great characters.  A feel-good movie"
1,"Very powerful piece of science fiction way, way ahead of its time.  With all the plastic surgery today and the ability of medicine to manipulate one's appearance, this was clearly a look into the future in 1966 when this film was made.  The only things I did not like about the movie was the cinematography and the careless editing of some scenes where a pillow disappears when Rock Hudson is in the plane.  Also, did not care about the hippie scene where they are making wine.  These non actors did not add anything to the movie plot."
1,Fun show to binge watch
1,best show on TV by far
1,"Outstanding acting by Benjamin Bratt.  Finally a series WITHOUT. grotesque killings, Foul mouth vocabulary, nudity in every scene.  A series where people are being helped and not killed .  Also realistic in the fact that not everyone is saved and FINALLY believing in a higher power which touch just do not see."
1,Great show. It has great acting for the script and the story line is fun.
1,Great show. Must watch from the beginning.
1,very cute and entertaining
1,"This show entertains both our 7 year old and 2 year olds! Clean humor for all, I even find myself enjoying the show!"
1,Please read the book first
1,Love
1,"Enjoyable mystery show, good characterization."
1,PRO:  action-packed sex and violence.  CON: UK rev of '24'?
1,scary
1,Great movie!
1,"I am on Season 3 and still loving this show. If you want to wrack your brain trying to figure out what's going on and what the result will be, this is a super fun show. Pay close attention to how much the color green shows up this season, they must have had extra gallons on the lot. Peter Graves is a much better actor than the wooden Steven Hill (Season 1s Dan Briggs)."
1,Excellent film. Outstanding performances by entire cast.  Compelling look at a painful time in this nation's history that is fully applicable today.
0,"Rhymes with &#34;horse manure.&#34; Incredibly dull, way too long, pointless. Even the avalanche scene is a yawner.<br /><br />OK, people brush their teeth and urinate. I got that the first time. I didn't need to see these actions repeated over and over, especially Mom squatting in the woods.<br /><br />Why the photography cutting off people's heads while they are talking? Maybe this is supposed to be &#34;art,&#34; but it looks like lousy cinematography.<br /><br />The DVD jacket quotes a review as &#34;Hilarious.&#34; Huh? &#34;Depressing&#34; would be more like it.<br /><br />The kids aren't even cute."
1,Philly is a great series.  I just wonder why on earth they stopped after season one.
1,"This is my wife and kids favorite family show. They are always begging to watch the next episode. Please make season 5, 6, 7 and so on."
1,Acting and production was fine.  I am and have always been underwhelmed by Hare's writing and directing.  LeCarre or Greene he is not.  What started off well in the first episode declined in the second and totally collapsed in the third.
1,great
1,Good movie. But not great. Trailer makes it seem a lot more to it.
1,my fav...will watch reruns over & over & still laugh...doesn't matter how many times I have seen any episode it's still funny to me!!!!!!!
1,The best Western ever made.  Great character development and plot.  Could not stop watching.  I hated to wait a week to see new episodes.  Now I see it anytime I want and I keep going back to see episodes I really enjoyed.
1,"omg, this show is effing hilarious.  The chemistry between the leads is perfect and this show would never work without it.  But I mean really--JUST WATCH IT.  I laughed so hard I peed."
0,Pretty much exactly what you would expect.
1,"Boring after a while. Mediocre acting. Story line becomes, &#34;So What?&#34;"
1,"Stayed true to the narrative arc, great ending."
1,"In 1993 in Beatrice, Nebraska the high school put on a play called the gallows. An accident occurred on stage were Charlie was hung. Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler)  joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.<br /><br />The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films.  We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming. I liked it. The problem I had with the twist is that there is a &#34;discovery&#34; of things that happened 20 years ago, secrets I didn't think would exist in a small town where everybody knows everyone's business.<br /><br />Guide: 1 whispered F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,These brave men and women who have fought and are still fighting..I say thank you and pray for you everyday!
1,I find something new and amazing to love about this movie every time I see it. Brilliant. I just watched it with my wife and she hadn't seen it before. Normally she hates almost every movie we watch but she LOVED Citizen K
1,The best.
1,"The action and suspense keep my heart pounding harder and harder through every show.  I need to watch a comedy or something to calm myself down after watching an episode.  The drama is just great.  The aliens are despicable and their apparent mastery of genetic technolgy makes them even more frightening than they appear.  Despite that, they seem somewhat intellectually challenged when it comes to actual battle strategy, thank God for the surviving humans.  They may just figure their superior technologies will win out in the end.  I keep waiting for the Earth germs to fight back."
1,A;WAYS GREAT
1,"Excellent movie. Turing was a true genius like Newton, Einstein and Tesla. Thanks to muck raking alarmists like Joe McCarty,we were denied new innovations in computer technology.<br />Interesting the queen waited until 2013 to exonorate Turing. Did the movie have anything to do with that."
1,Great series twist and turns to keep you guessing typical King!
0,Dumber than most
1,Flashpoint is exciting and hair raising.  It shows both sides in stressful situations.
0,"Sorry, I thought this was one of the worst WW2 movies--in fact, any war movie--I've ever watched. There were technical things wrong and the acting was not so good either. Now, you may enjoy it--I'm not saying that--but I'll never watch it again. Poor writing, directing, and acting; things like uniforms being pristine while men are in the field, shiny parts on rifles, etc. No thanks."
1,Excellent season!
1,I believe that this pilot has a great story to reveal as a conman lives with a family who help one and another and grow towards  better life .
1,Great
1,"One of my favorite series, if not my very favorite. The storylines are so real, many taken from actual news. Acting is impeccable, starting with Jeff Daniels (&#34; Will McAvoy&#34;) and Emily Mortimer (&#34;Mackenzie McHale&#34;). And the writing by Aaron Sorkin (of the &#34;West Wing&#34; fame) is unmatchable, unique.<br /><br />If other TV series were half like this, TV would mortally wound the movies."
0,Moved slow with a weak plot.<br />Not much on action or graphics.<br />Acting was surprising decent.<br />Quick anticlimactic confusing ending.
1,Good for kids
1,Interesting
1,"It's more crass and shows more bedroom action than necessary, but I appreciate the couples sense of humor."
1,Its OK..
0,"Very slow story, lacked any interest, was in English subtitles."
1,I think it was great. But I couldn't watch more than 15 min. I'm too sensitive. I'm already a vegan and animal activist.
1,Great show
0,A waste of time.  Couldn't stand to watch the whole thing
1,Love this movie! I've watched it several times and it's still funny as ever.
1,Love it!
1,"Ignore the bad science and the rest of the film is a bit better than decent. I watched this film via Amazon video and was very disappointed in the sound mix. Voices were so low at times, I suppose trying to show how calm folks were, but the music and other sound effects drowned out so much of the dialog, at times trying to show how desperate/dangerous some situations were.  Frustrating trying to guess at what was being said so often."
1,Awesome season hope there is going to be a season 4
1,Love this show
1,This movie really opened my eyes to what people  went through at that time. I thought the actors did a marvelous job.
1,"can't wait to see the next episode. Such fun with a family that<br />talks all at once , has lots of conflicts but really really supports each other!!"
1,I'm hooked waiting to see what happens next.
1,Great history that I was not fully aware of
1,Kids love it.
0,I am not dying to know what happens next and find myself not caring about any of the characters very much.... Surprised this has multiple seasons. Plot is a little thin and the acting is mediocre but I will continue watching since I started.
1,Absolutely makes you want to understand the &#34;street side&#34; of life!  The environment is one of survival and not a loving healthy atmosphere!<br />Explains a lot to me about the violence and the drugs with the short life expectancy.
1,The best storyline is Vito Spatafore being gay. Great idea and great acting and writing as usual.
1,I loved everything but the ending. I was hoping to have some questions answered by the end but no.  The ending felt like a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.  There will obviously be a sequel.
1,"Excellent addition to the series.  Lots of stunts were over the top and people not dying in situations you know they could never survive.  But hey, that's why they call it entertainment"
1,Great update on the classic TMNT franchise.
1,I loved it.
1,mildly funny
0,Awful!
1,I love this show!!
1,Love this show!
1,"They put a lot of research and work into finding out the best way to do things in the kitchen, and add great recipes with these skills."
1,"Absolutely nothing to watch but techno-digitally-mastered effects targeting appropriately educated barely-reading native language viewers.<br /><br />Used to reproducing ruling elite brides try to escape nowhere on a deserted planet and finished where they started at on expense of a couple lives, limbs and tones of fuel burnt and machinery destroyed.<br /><br />If this is a vision of a Horizonte a contemporary feudalistic society marches to, the idea is really brilliantly-mad presented."
1,"Knowing that this was the last year for The Newsroom kind of took the edge off of Season 3. But still a 5 star show, cast and writing. The ending was well done and who knows, maybe they will do a follow-up movie in the future."
1,"My 8 year old LOVES this show. I also enjoy it, which is nice because we can watch together and I can be a part of the discussion around science, the value of having a good attitude, self confidence, learning to be ok with mistakes because they are part of discovery...and so much more. This show is entertaining while it shows values of friendship, perseverance and creativity."
1,Have watched this show from season 1
1,"striking a lovely balance between the comedy and the reality of their lives. Refreshing and unique, with profound moments that really resonate within (see the end of Episode 4) which make this not your usual half hour sitcom. Worth the binge, especially because you'll be craving more!!"
0,Ok but not great
1,"Great addition to the black and white, Cary Grant collection.  Yes, this one goes to the dramatic, Kleenex demanding side, but he's still Cary Grant.  Wish the transfer had been better, obviously this wasn't film to digital, there must have been a fuzzy tape intermediate.  But still watchable."
1,Wonderful show that encourages children to figure things out
1,Over the top computer effects.
1,"Video kept stopping and re-downloading over and over and over. Very hard to get into the story. My connection showed 4 bars, the highest connection possible. The problem has to be Amazon.  So we switched to netflix and no more re-starts."
1,So funny!
1,I enjoyed it
1,"Although a predictable &#34;detective formula&#34; Bosch's character, done expertly by Titus Welliver, draws the audience in and doesn't let go. I will watch season two just to see him interact with his fabulous supporting cast."
1,Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty GREAT!
0,This show has totally gone off the rails.
1,"What a great messages. What a great song. I am so ready to help others and this is my song of action. Thank you Matthew West! Oh the drums really drive to song, yes I play drums!"
1,"This is a series that demands concentration, No action, no sex, just interesting, thoughtful dialog"
1,Obsessed with Melrose Place.
1,I enjoyed this cute little movie.  International flavor and interesting story.  Enjoy!
1,The backpack.  That is the greatest scene ever filmed.  Stu! Stu! Stuuuuu!
1,Great movie. Social concerns addressed about dying with dignity
0,"Slow paced, belied with soapy s***. Shows like Caprica did a better job. I missed the first 2 episodes and paid for them here at Amazon. I wouldn't mind the time if not the money back."
1,I loved this movie. Amy Adams is one of my favorite actresses and she shines in this movie.
1,Quirky with dark humor.
1,"this was an awesome series..it just ended way too soon..i would have liked to see at least 2 more seasons..the entire cast had great chemistry as a cast, and as  individuals pairing off..bravo!!"
1,A must see. A tarentino masterpiece.
1,A great show the first two episodes. I can't wait to see where it goes next!
1,Awesome movie for anyone interested in the 1L law school experience!
1,a
1,Great special effects and a good story line!
1,Pretty good
1,Excellent!!!
1,great movie it was a classic
1,Very insightful
1,Smart and funny ... can't help but binge watch this show.
1,Brilliant
1,The best - extremely entertaining and very well acted.  Hope Season 6 becomes available on Prime.  Love my Prime
1,"It's good but there are a lot of things that I did not expect to see, which isn't good really."
1,"This show was well done, pretty witty with some definite laugh-out-loud moments.  Well worth the time to watch the whole season in one sitting!  Looking forward to the next season to come out."
1,Would love it!
1,Long!
1,"A superb series, great character development - Too bad for last season is here!"
0,"Great actors and a great director... but somehow the movei falls flat on its face.  By trying to make a biblical history somewhat realistic, they made it so that it looks really absurd.  The story is painfully long and boring."
1,Can't wait..
0,not much here
1,my husband and i both enjoy this show.
1,Great show that I have ENJOYED!
1,Great acting by Tatiana. Complex and suspenseful storyline.
1,My daughters and I love this show. Wish they'd make more.
1,Great actors with a great story line.

1,"This show is great! Love the personalities, filming & story lines!"
1,Have enjoyed series so far
1,Very good. I will  watch again
1,Very good. .enjoyed the storyline.
1,I find these shows interesting to watch however I wish there was more live action shots and less talk.
1,"Rudy Maxa brings real wit and charm to his spot-on travelogues, covering everything from the grandeur of palaces and mountains to the intimate delicacies of the perfect small cafÃ©. They really are &#34;Smart Travels&#34;."
1,"Exciting, fun, romantic and suspenseful, with a cast of characters any viewer of this kind of series will love. Also get a quick peek at many exotic locales."
1,Great show for older toddlers. My almost 3 year old LOVES it. I am a fan of Bob. He is a bear. His name is Bob. That is comedy gold.
1,Very creative and new!  I have had to turn my head a couple of times because it is gruesome!!!  But AWESOME!!!
1,Wonderfully written and full of great information you may not know about the Roosevelts.
1,Very funny adult humor
1,Classic for all ages
1,Keeps you on edge throughout.
1,"Possibly the best season yet. Everyone is at peak..except Matt Czuchary, who plays Cary Agos. He has two expressions: bewilderment and quizzical.<br />Great program."
1,Too long and a bit illogical.
1,Tom seller's is wonderful.
0,Its gotten boring.
1,Great movie! Just like I remembered with I was a kid.
1,It was did not catch that it was a trailer
1,She is so funny .... I was in tears laughing so hard .... I would watch her again and again
0,I fell asleep
1,"Good, but depressing!"
1,Hadn't watch this in a long time and forgot just how good it really is.
1,Excellent
1,Such an awesome little short that is sure to amuse everyone my daughter loved this short
1,refreshing
1,"A very nice movie. Great for the whole family. With the exception of the profanity outburst from Frankie dad, the movie was totally enjoyed."
0,"Typical 70's movie. Boys meets girl, girl wants different guy and boy wants all of the girls. Oh and there is a van or two or three!"
1,I didn't like it.
1,The humor is so great and the characters are amazing!!!
1,Great second season. Love the show!!!
1,"I'm a Costner fan, so I endured this film. It was just OK. That said, I can see why it was box office flop."
1,fun
1,Just keeps getting better.
0,"This was too strange and slow moving for me. I could not finish watching it. Maybe the ending turns out to be some wonderful climax to all of the weird, strange, unexplained stuff that was going on in the first half, but I'll never know."
1,Suspenseful!
1,.....of course it have unbelievable action scenes from the very beginning but this is not a true story drama. If you like the previous ones you will like this one
1,"This show is baller as hell, even more baller than Ballers..."
1,surprisingly great movie! My daughter (10) loves it!
1,My 22 month toddler loves the show!
1,The acting was very good. Well-directed movie. The plot was a bit opaque.
1,"One of the best shows on TV these days. The show is directed, and acted upon, perfectly. A must watch!"
0,"I didn't finish this movie because I thought it was silly and juvenile... There is a French film with the same title.  I thought it was better, but it is in French and has subtitles."
1,It was just ok.
1,"Seasons 1-5 are terrific. Season 6-7 disappointed. I give season 5 a full 5 stars bcuz its one of the 2 best seasons...for me,  it's between season 4 or 5."
0,Not a real good plot line.
1,LOVED IT!!!...cant wait for the next episode...
1,Excellent series. Very well done.
0,The story line was good
1,Great movie for the entire family!
1,"Great show, although I wish the writers would let chief Reagan loosen up a little and not always take the office home."
1,"This spoke to me as a 42 year old real man on many levels. I have been divorsed, had jobs, been in corporate america and in jeneral, a goffy pot head...... like 80% of us today in tue great US of A. If you smoke once a month,,,, you fall into this 80%â€¦ fyi....  :)  Peace an  love man,, youll dig this flick."
1,Spot on with the original documentary giving insights to how big and little Edie got to coditions they were in durring filming of same.
0,Not bad could be better
1,mystery...gripping your seat....
1,Good
0,"Dull, slow. The director makes a concerted effort to create a moody, dreamy atmosphere. Instead, it is simply a sad disappointment. All characters are none that you could be psychologically invested in and when you don't care who lives or dies, and have no interest in how it ends, it is useless to continue to watch."
1,gritty
1,Awesome
1,"It was very well acted, suspenseful, and loved the storyline."
1,Great show similar to Hawaii 5-o. Hope they kept the seasons coming.
1,A great show.  On season 3 now.  Addicted.
1,This is an excellent history on tuberculosis.  I had no idea it was so widespread at one time.  This explains why and when so many sanatoriums were built around the world and in the US.  It also describes how the first vaccines were discovered and how dangerous the 'resistant' bacteria are today.
1,like watching it!!!
1,I love these two together.  It was a fun movie.
1,Love it
0,"I zoned out & started playing on my phone.  This wasn't a good Dracula movie at all, which is sad because I like the dude that plays the main character.  I typically also love most vampire movies, even the cheesy bad ones like Lost Boys.  Ah well, they can't all be good."
1,Loved it
1,Awesome!!!
1,Great fun!  But don't watch it with your parents.  You'll know why I say this when you get to the end.
1,This is such an awesome show. Tatiana plays all the clones and she is awesome at it.
1,"Fantastic, original, and inspiring - to say the least. Full of humorous moments. A must see classic"
1,would like to see more
0,"Why do war movies get everything wrong? This is supposed to be about the battle for the Kall Trail, part of the horrendous Battle of the Huertgen Forest in 1944. That was a very interesting, bloody conflict. However, in the movie, the terrain is all wrong (the Kall trail is a steep trail down into a deep ravine where it crosses a little stream before rising back up a steep trail--in the movie it looks like the Rio Grande), the tactics are from the trenches of WWI, not WWII (the soldiers all stand up together and slowly walk on line to get slaughtered), and the weapons are ridiculous (the German 88 and tanks are direct fire weapons, not artillery).<br />Not sure how making this movie with just a tiny bit of historical accuracy would have been so difficult. Is it because the writers/producers/directors are stupid, or because they are lazy, or because they actually do want to portray the past incorrectly?"
1,Yes.
1,"Good intro-level set of workouts.  As an intermediate, I often do slightly harder variants on the poses (particularly where Yee wants your back knee on the ground, as this is hard on my knees).  Yee does not suggest harder versions in most cases, but the poses are familiar enough that any intermediate could do the same.  For props, he uses a strap, a block, and a rolled up blanket, depending on the workout."
1,Always great
1,Very Fast Paced Series and each episode leaves you longing for more.  Great Acting by the main and supporting cast with a complex script that makes the comedic drama a must watch!!!
1,"Good acting, charismatic actors and characters. Nice storyline and the '50s fashion!"
1,Very engaging.
1,Cheesy yet a must-see.
1,"I watched this series on local tv a couple years ago and always regreted that they cancelled the transmission. Now that it is available on Prime videos I'm glad I could watch it daily. The series is good overall, it is mostly focused on the Reagan family which has a tradition of being cops for several generations. I think the series is successful in showing how our lives and the way we live it could lead people to committing crimes or being victims as well.<br /><br />I watch an episode on a daily basis and I'm already thinking of what will happen when I watch the last episode, I guess I'll miss it as you miss an old friend.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
1,"his movie is fantastic,funny and real..a must watch at least once!"
1,Addicted
1,enjoy the trilogy of this film and any thing  to do with the Templars I am a fan!!!  thank you amazon for these international movies!!!
1,The movie had a nice twist
1,Always a classic...
1,This was really good glad I bought it Matthew Mc Conaughey is a great actor. The Dallas Buyers club was real good as well.
1,Engaging storyline and novel concept.  Not your typical alien story.
1,"Although I like this for its characters and their interactions, I am tiring of everyone (the lawyers) filing charges when they feel slighted. Maybe it is a subtle joke although I do not care for the mendacious nature of the characters. Will watch all episodes and then re-watch them. The ongoing plot line is very well done although the writers somehow dropped the ball when the main character (Mike Ross) and his girlfriend attempt to elude an attempt at blackmailing by the managing partner by having the girlfriend move to California. The changes her mind but the threat against Ross never materializes."
1,Fantastic!!!!!!!
1,Funniest show in the world. Yopu would be a monster to hate it.
1,Loved it!
1,I loved this show so much I want more! Much more!
1,Wonderful show
1,Good adaptation of the book.  Let's hope the rest are like the pilot.
1,"As an adult I thought it was a bit long, a lot of dialog for younger kids..."
1,"I watched it when I came on television, but I couldn't remember everything about it.  I had remembered that it was a little strange.  It is a little strange, but I don't regret watching it.  I don't hate it, but I don't love it either.  I plan to watch the 2nd season, mostly because I don't remember how it ended."
0,Worst movie i've ever seen ever. Thank you for Prime.
1,Love the sauce.  Love the story behind it.
1,"Standard fare. Not sub standard, but standard.  Kind of like it was built to help pass the time until the next installment of Hunger Games.  Seems a bit of a step down for Kate Winslet."
0,We only got about 30 min into it before turning it off- the acting was terrible! I felt like we were watching a Disney TV show
1,I really like it. well acted. great story. not a real upper but good drama. Makes you think. Life is precious.
1,Anyone who can make a movie out of two shower stalls and some blinking lights is amazing. I guess they left off the ending either for a squeal or just to exercise your imagination.  My wife would not watch because she instantly labeled it science fiction after seeing the blinking lights. It is fiction in as much as theoretical quantum mechanics is just that.  Not many special effects and a little over acting. I will stop before I provide any spoilers.
1,LOVE this series!!
1,Awesome.....I believe... Justin Timberlake can fill the role as Brian's Brother in Furious 8.......
1,great show - wish there was a 2nd season
1,Learned everything I will ever need to know about the household staffs duties. Very interesting show.
1,Pretty good!!!
0,"Sound quality very poor.  Worn-out story.  Poor acting, even from Bruce Willis and John Cusack."
0,Not horrible. It did not have the thematic or cinematic elements I expected.
0,"Words escape me...it was a waste of time, I'm shocked Ethan Hawke even accepted this role"
1,Reminissant of Breaking Bad. Loving this show!!!
1,Love Suits!
1,"Held my interest first season and 1/2 through the second season. After that it became too much of the things that annoyed and irritated me, such as  poor performances for example or the plot development."
1,Great show!
1,Charming period piece.
0,I adore British humor but this isn't worth watching.  Sorry!
1,This movie is full of action and comedy...will miss Paul Walker in the future shows.
1,Sure with they'd hurry up and come out with another episode!
1,"This show is absolutely beautiful. My daughter (2.5) is so into it, and it carries over into her play every day. She is always acting out scenes and pretending to Maple or Fig. The characters are positive and creative. The images and colors are striking without being over stimulating. It is very well done! I can't wait for more seasons."
1,Love it.
0,Painfully horribly not funny
1,I'm ready for next season!
1,"Wonderful characters, great acting and a show full of suspense and great special effects! The characters make this series without a doubt."
1,Just a flashback to the 80's
1,Love when Meryl sings - especially the ending
1,Not at all what I expected. If we could all love like that.
1,While I gave the movie 5 stars there was some language that was offensive to my 9 & 10 year old Grandchildren. The overall content of the movie was excellent!!
1,Makes you realize about small town where people cares.
0,Weird and boring.
1,funny
1,Nice story about an intelligent young boy.  Good ending too!
0,HATED the ending.  The end made me regret watching the movie.
1,This series is slowly growing on me . . .
1,Pretty amazing show. Very creative and sweet.
1,Good show. Cop show with a twist. Safe to watch with no bad language.
1,It was a bit slow at times but I enjoyed.
1,"If you are over 18 this film will not work for you. I turned from Stephen Greenblatt's book, &#34;Swerve&#34; for a break but this film lacks swerve, lacks a solid script and experienced enough actors to bring it off.  The parents are nicely played, always loving, always fun but the script isn't heavy enough for novice actors to &#34;create&#34; weight enough and lift their burden as creators to the level of art. The &#34;swervy&#34; conclusion, unfortunately, does not justify the hour or so investment getting there. It's an old gimmick captured years ago in a better way by Ambrose Bierce's &#34;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.&#34;"
0,Depressing. Jack Bauer as psychotic. Grotesque scenes of violence. Worse than any other season
1,It was entertaining
1,Well Done...
1,Excellent show. Bad form of A&E for canceling.
0,Horrible acting and production!  It was obvious this was a cheap film.
1,"Lead female is Wonderful, wonderful!!!"
1,Great movie!
1,delightful way to relax while having some dinner
1,Great series
1,This was an adorable movie! I am quite surprised it did not do better. A few moments where the acting could have been better but I thoroughly enjoyed it!
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ»
1,great
0,"What could be bad about Fred Astaire, Judy Garland and that gorgeous music?  And added In Ann Miller! Not to mention a very young sweet Peter Lawford. It may be a bit hackneyed to say but they just don't make them like those two anymore."
1,The kids enjoy Angelina Ballerina. I prefer the cartoon style over the animation style.
1,"First rate! Great cast, very compelling storyline."
1,I am half way through the movie and screaming at the screen what kind of parents do this to this children??? REALLY?? This is a great movie about how the church is cult trying to brainwash people. They moved out of the country in an effort to get around laws that protect people's rights here in the states. These students need to sue these people out of business.
1,It was a great movie.
1,"This is a well written show with a talented core group of actors. It makes you pay attention so you don't miss a critical turn of events that leaves wondering, &#34;What just Happened?&#34; Yet it is done mainly in a light, freewheeling style that deceiving while the script throws your emotions from point A to point Z and back again to everything in between. Watch it."
1,Entertaining.
0,good
1,Lots of fun!
0,did not even watch 15 minutes of the show. Perhaps the subtitles diminished the movie experience.
1,"The greatest screenplay ever written in my opinion. Paddy Chayevsky's words still ring true 40 years later. Peter Finch, William Holden, Faye Dunaway and Beatrice Strait all received Oscars for their performances. Robert Duval was nominated. Should have won Best Picture Oscar, but lost to Rocky."
1,Love this series
0,Disappointing
1,"Considerably darker than previous seasons. I was surprised to see the Observers become malevolent interventionists with no real explanation. I also thought it was funny that they were still driving 2013 (and earlier) cars in 2036. But despite all that, it's still one of my favorite shows, & I was sorry to see it end."
1,Both my boys loved this show
1,Good action and plot. Not a prude but soft porn not necessary for story.
1,Love this show
1,grandkids love it!
1,Great show...well-written.
0,It felt like I was watching an After School Special. Turned it off after 30 minutes.
1,Very good movie
1,just really like it....cool characters
1,Giovanni Ribisi creates interesting characters. First saw him in the X-Files where he delivered an &#34;electrifying&#34; performance.
1,Funny and character interaction are fantastic.
1,It was very good I did like it
1,The action was great.  It had all the favorite action actors.
1,"Wow, was I ever pleasantly surprised. This is one very good action movie. I enjoyed it very much. Why it was not a box office hit is a wonder to me. It has all the ingredients. I suppose the aroma of the Stallone stinker of the 90's followed this movie, jinxing its box office potential. Total shame this is a really good movie. Not a remake of the Stallone movie, an entirely new one. I at first thought it was gonna be a remake and almost didn't rent it. I am glad I did, and not only that I decided to buy it. It really is that good. BUT...forewarned. It is extremely violent. And gory. I also think that the movie would have been even better had the violence and gore been toned down a bit."
1,Love this movie
1,Great show interesting characters new twists each week
1,Best show ever
0,"Remarkably predictable script could only have been written by an elementary school student.  Is it supposed to be a spy action romance or be a parody of one?  Either way, it fails miserably.  I felt bad for the actors and cannot imagine why someone of Zhang Ziyi's caliber (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Memoirs of a Geisha) would even be involved in this."
1,"Very short episodes, but solid"
1,"I anticipated this movie would not be a let down, and it wasn't. I didn't think they could keep high paced energy, but they did. Even the passing of Paul Walker, didn't take away from this movie. I bought the movie and will continue to watch it as long I can."
0,Not my type of series
1,very good movie.
0,It is a good teen movie.. Is sweet
1,"Great movie, could watch over & over again"
1,Great show

1,Thank you
1,"Very imaginative, and great art work. I also love how the lessons are presented to the children."
1,K
0,Not the greatest movie!
1,"To me, this is one of the best seasons. It really ended playing an almost &#34;good vs. evil&#34;. Certain characters seemed as though they would be insignificant and yet made for an entertaining event. The reunion show illustrated that it was not simply a matter of editing but that some of these characters truly were just as you saw them in each episode. The challenges were well crafted and Gabon made for a beautiful setting."
0,A piece of trash if I ever saw one; couldn't make it past the vomiting scene...
1,Very entertaining
0,I couldn't get through the first episode.
1,Not too bad...
1,"I never imagined a show would be created where people speak they way I do! thank you for making this funny, and realistic version of things that happen to us all!!!!"
1,"One of the best tv shows out there. Thoughtful and heartrending yet light and humorous. Profound and captivating. A rare set of characters that grow and develop, transcending simplistic roles as protagonist and antagonist."
1,"Great story with very funny characters. Be warned though, they sing... A lot! That annoys some and I wasn't expecting it so thought I should mention it. My five year old loved it and I thought it was great!"
1,"Great acting, witty dialogue, very entertaining."
0,This movie was so bad I turned it off in the first 15 minutes. Even though there were some notable people in it it still stunk. I can't believe this movie was ever made. The only other movie I turned off was dumb and dumber.
1,Such wonderful characters portrayed well by both actors
1,Loved this series... puts a whole new perspective on our nations history.  Acting was superb. I was not aware that this series even existed until I got the Amazon Fire.
0,Waste of money.
1,Good movie! Worthy to watch!
1,Great show! Love Giovanni Ribisi
0,"I've tried watching Empire season 1 when it first came out, I lasted maybe 20 min before I changed channels. Recently on Amazon I tried watching again that lasted 15 min. IMO it's very boring."
1,"Great show for my PokÃ©mon crazy boys, they love to watch the show and play the game."
1,up to episode 8
1,Love this series and I really enjoy being able to watch without commercials or any interruptions when I want and where I want. Halle Berry and Goran Visnijic  are an amazing and give the story a lot depth working together.  Both are extremely charismatic  and captivating as the story in bringing to life the notion that aliens from another world are among us  and how robotics are  advanced. &#34;Oh how my imagination is stirred with each and every episode&#34;.
1,"This is such a well-done comedy, especially if you love the world of stage theatre.  The acting was excellent, as the roles were perfectly cast and perfectly exploiting certain personality types.  It was just an enjoyable evening to watch such a funny movie!"
1,It was interesting and beautiful.
1,NOT A BAD FLICK. NOT A GREAT FLICK. IT WAS PRETTY COOL TO SEE HADER AND WIGG IN THE SAME FLICK.
1,kept you watching
1,good
1,Awesome series
1,Very good movie..........  well written and acted.
1,"A great pilot, eagerly awaiting the full season."

1,This movie was fantastic! I love the action scenes! The story was very intriguing.
1,Good stuff
0,Didn't even make it past the first 20 mins....
1,An excellent show
1,"I like the story and the message.  However, the acting could use some improvement."
1,Must see.
1,Ross Poldark is undoubtedly the most romantic man. Delmeeza is his true soulmate. They compliment each other perfectly. The acting is superb. This series will have you experiencing a flood of emotions!
1,More episodes please!
1,Well done.
1,This movie was OK.  It had action and it kept my interest.
1,Nice.
1,good movie
1,didnt think I would like it as much as previous seasons but I was wrong.. what a great show!
1,Excellent. I recommend more episodes
1,Terrific!
1,"Really long pilot that dragged, but weirdly enough kept my interest. I hope the episodes following the pilot get more action."
1,Good movie
0,They end up writing a graphic sex novel (cartoon drawings)  I stopped watching.  It could have been a neat collaboration had the product been something meaningful.
0,This is not a good movie
1,"I wish the entire series was on Prime, not just the &#34;best of.&#34;"
1,"I recognized the story from the book, but Titus Welliver made it interesting all over again."
1,Have been wanting to see this for some time now and it did not disappoint.
0,"It had potential, but it was just put together poorly. Too many massive leaps in the events and little explanation to go along with it. Maybe that was the point, a trippy experience that is left up to the imagination to make sense of it all. A movie seems to lack the story telling a book can do to fill in the gaps."
1,"Good old Western. Union officer gets cleared of Cowardice charges, beats the bad guy, finds the right girl and is reunited with his son."
1,"This is worth watching, I enjoyeded it.  If you are not familiar with Sam, you should take the time to watch this.  His fingers were in a lot of things."
0,"Not comical. I was looking for some laughs, this is not it. This is a psychological evaluation of comedians."
1,"Only ran one season , much better than many others that are back."
1,Good story. Excellent TV series. Good quality acting and nice effects.
1,great action and actors
1,Fantastic show with fantastic actors!!!  Be sure to watch for Elizabeth J. Carlisle in season 2!
1,Great!
1,Cleaver modern Charlie Brown character among the self-absorbed LA crowd.
0,"I did not like this at all. They spent a lot of time trying to develop the characters and inner relationship aspects, which to me became very boring after about 40 min. Actually, I was bored earlier, but kept watching just in case it got better. Turned it off before it was even over, don't care what happens to the people and I'm going to ask for my money back."
1,I didn't think it was going to be this good. I started out by thinking it was only worth two stars before I really watched it. It made me laugh. My children were singing the songs the next day.
1,Great movie with a real good life lesson!
1,"This show is hilariously funny.  I only gave it 4 stars though, as there was an episode in either Season 3 or Season 4 where the language was too offensive.  In general, Larry David is a laugh riot and his character is such a fussy fellow!!!"
1,What a great series.  I can't wait for the next season.
1,This was a good movie.  A little hard to follow at first but made sense in the end.
1,"Well done, great casting worth watching"
1,A much different flavor that the first season. I can only assume there was a change in the writers. I still like it a lot though.
1,Really amazing and addicting show I love it
1,i was born and raised in NOLA.  this program touches me deeply.....greatly written and filmed.
1,Excellent
1,"I love this show, and i cant wait for season 3."
1,Interesting and reviting! Always sometihing happening.
1,Mundane with a telegraphed/foreshadowing of the twists and turns in the action. The movie did not grip my imagination except for the fairly good portrayal of a psychopath who has learned the social nuances of good or acceptable answers and behaviors that suit his needs when interacting with people.
1,My son loves it.
1,Like it
1,Good
1,very funny
1,Great movie!!  Very touching!!  You will need tissues!
0,Terrible writing and worse acting. I tried to watch--made it through 3 episodes before I had to quit.
1,Need to finish watching it.... Kept getting distracted
0,"Creepy, cole and quite repellant...."
1,Loved this movie!! Romantic and beautiful.
1,Enjoying it immensely. Throwback from my childhood.
1,"Movies about perseverance and survival are my favorites, especially when about true events.  This one was nicely done, not 'over the top'."
1,"Hubby likes it.  Not my type of series.  However, the female main character is a very good actress.  Very talented."
1,Great show
1,Ok little film
0,Movie was so so.  Neither my husband nor I liked it much.
1,Our two year old granddaughter loves this show.
1,Good action. Not for kids.
1,"If you like pirate flicks this can entertain you for a while, it's not great, Geena made a good pirate."
1,Love this show.  The family is very likeable with interesting characters. Only negative is that sometimes it seems like they say the same things over and over.
1,"My 2 year old loves Sesame Street.  It's simple, educational and interesting."
1,Typical but good...Fair share of the usual stuff we like...chases and guns and whatever.
1,Awesome!
1,My 2.5 year old girl really likes it!  Loving these new Amazon originals.
1,Love it. Looking forward to many more seasons.
1,For a family who live in very rural Missouri the program is a virtual education in drug probems in this country.
1,great show

0,not as good as the book
1,Very informative
0,"The acting is terrible. The story is bad. A waste of time, I only made it half way thru."
1,Good movie. Hard to swallow statement about our society.  Be ready to feel your heart stop.
1,"Get this story line right out of todayâ€™s mad social media driven desperate cry for recognition in a sullen, indifferent world.  A hard-nosed, hard-hitting newspaper reporter who liked his liquor, liked his women, liked to live close to the edge on a story, hell was willing to go over the top six ways to Sunday in order to sell the bossâ€™s newspapers (and he was not particular about which boss as long as he go that by-line, got that big fat check). Get this too was willing, way more than willing to throw the truth out with bath water in order to keep the story humming for a few extra days, or until the juice was sucked out of the damn thing. Of course guys (gals too but our protagonist is a guy on this one) like our boy, Chuck, Chuck Tatum, maybe you read his by-line when he was riding the big wave, who live for wine, women, song and a big chunk of fame have a habit over going over the edge a little too much for the city editors of most newspapers taste which has caused him to be thrown off half the best newspapers in the country.<br /><br />As we hone in on the story line Chuck is cooling his heels out in Albuquerque, on some nowhere square dink newspaper where the editor/owner thinks you should tell the truth straight and without the garnish, funny guy right. Finds himself out there where the states are square and the people left to their own resources by their own choice had better treat one another square, and be square or else. So our big city reporter was just looking for that one little story to ride him back to the big time, to easy street, what the heck maybe to that Pulitzer Prize that has eluded him all these years.<br /><br />And lo and behold out in the middle of Podunk on his way to cover yet another hoe-down or picnic in the boondocks Chuck gets his lucky break, a story a real live human interest story, the kind that people stop whatever they are doing to follow, the one that has them on the phone telling one and all their exact opinion of what is happening, with baited breathe. Here is the beauty of this one, a guy, a regular Joe (although his name is Leo but nobody cares about the name as much as the one-on-one human interest about what is happening to some poor sap who is in more trouble than they are, not much more was caught in a cave looking for relics around the mountains which the local Indians, oops Native Americans, you know the native peoples and needs help getting out, help which in the normal scheme of events would take a few hours and done. Except our boy Chuck smelled this for a million dollar story anyway you cut it, a story that every poor sucker who reads the newspapers form Podunk to New Jack City could relate to, if he can keep the thing alive long enough to draw an audience. So the catch is too get the guy out, but not too some. Through some very devious methods and some pure high-handed power-plays Chuck shows his reckless expertise, gets so wrapped up in the thing that he can see the bright lights of the city as fast  as he can write, and finagle things so that he gets exclusives, the almighty exclusives that separate the pros from the amateurs in the newspaper business. The key though was to keep that story going and that is where everything turned to dross in the end. See Chuck ordered the rescue crews to do the rescuing of poor sap Leo the long way round, you know, to keep the story going, has the crowds attracted by his stories coming out to observe the human drama in person on edge, has made the whole thing a  media circus. Key to that was getting Leo tough/hard as nails/sexy snake of a wife to work the ropes with him. And she, Lorraine, like all blonde Lorraines played her part well once our boy Chuck who, frankly, seemed to have been hard on his women, got under her skin (and gave her the franchise in the gathering circus end of the game). Of course there was a down side to Chuckâ€™s scheming since Leo refused to cooperate by getting a little short of breath waiting for that longway around digging to get to him, yeah the poor guy  folded up under the cave-in pressure and didnâ€™t last long enough to get the big headline. Great big fifteen minutes of fame story if there ever was one.<br /><br />Sounds like any other news story of today 24/7/367 media frenzy of the moment though, right. Wrong this is the skinny, the real skinny this one came in 1951. This one is famed director Billy Wilderâ€™s (he the super-max daddy director of the close up sordid underbelly look at old time Hollywood in Sunset Boulevard) Ace In The Hole as he takes a big swing at the newspaper business in the days when that medium ruled the roost of mass communication and when like today with the expansive social media mega-reach the notion of â€œall the news that fit to printâ€ hinged on how many paper it would sell. Kirk Douglas as the cranky, over-the-top news hound Chuck gives a very good performance here as does Jan Sterling as Lorraine, that hustling wife of poor old Leo. Hey, I didnâ€™t tell you the ending, the real ending not poor schmuck Leoâ€™s running out of air but Chuckâ€™s. In the end Chuck got â€œreligionâ€ (helped by a friendly mortal wound from Lorraine when he decided one more time to play rough with her), see before he too passed from the scene he realized that he had gone over the edge, had set something in motive better left to the fates. Yeah, thatâ€™s the real cautionary tale sixty some years later."
0,I didnt know people could be so cruel and saddist.
1,"Liked the humor.  Characters were well fleshed out and even though they all had flaws, I was still able to like them.  Jeffrey was one of the ugliest women I have ever seen.  Liked the relationship between Josh and the rabbi."
1,Mr Selfridge is one of my favorite Masterpiece Theaters productions. I would like to see all the Seasons again. Very sorry that it has been canceled.  I loved the story line and the way the characters are developed. Just love it.
1,Interesting cases of ghost sightings.  Really enjoyed watching.  I would recommend it!!
0,Boring
1,Audrey Hepburn was beautiful.  Just a fun fantasy movie.  Eddie Albert pops in every now and then.  Gregory Peck played a really good role too.
1,"Very believable characters and heartwarming family interactions.  Fair amount of alcohol consumption, but guess that's consistent with the setting. Love the whole series!"
1,Wonderful!!!!!  Highly recommend.
1,Awesome dry humour.
0,Confusing plot. Characters made little sense.
1,Entertaining!
1,"Very tense. A little over the top, but entertaining. Similar to &#34;24&#34;."
0,Didn't like it
1,Absolutely hilarious! ;)
1,Was a heartwarming story with great characters.
1,Loved this since I was a kid!
1,"Awesome production, storytelling and acting! Love it!!"
0,Very bland acting and boring story line.  5 Episodes to tell this story is a bit much.
1,"Surprisingly good, right from the start. I've seen a lot of low budget sci-fi that took too long to build the story and was boring. There are some akward moments, but I enjoyed the characters, especially Robin DeMarco, she was excellent. The ending was a surprise twist that I really enjoyed. It shows how you can make a good movie on a slim budget."
1,My 3 and 5 year old kids really enjoy this show and there's always a little lesson to be learned.  They often bust out in song with one of the songs about a lesson they learned on the show.
1,Ok movie
1,Great movie
1,It's an older movie but a really good movie
1,Very Good
1,I save Veronica for just before I need to wind down and go to bed. Not too stimulating.
1,Our son absolutely LOVES this show - in fact - he loves it so much he insists on watching it every mealtime.
1,Well done......always interesting
1,"The human struggle is a universal concept and, individually, each of the characters show what it is like to be gay, lesbian and even a miner during the times of margaret thatcher in the 80's.  Very few movies make me smile at the end...but this one did and i'll have to say that when you have a compelling story and a likable cast, the net result is a very brilliant movie. Bravo!!"
1,Great
1,"glad I stumbled upon this,just a wee bit sentimental but smart dialogue."
1,Best series we have watched.
1,"Great series, I wish I had watched years ago. She has skills and even though it deals with high school and college students it still keeps you in suspense. I have been watching the entire series doesn't get boring at all"
1,cute movie.  sad not included in amazon prime though
1,Love it
0,"Did not hold my interest. Too predictable and boring. I fast forwarded through most of the movie. Also, I hate subtitles in movies where I speak both languages fluently. I wish there were a way to turn subtitles on/off. I always check to make sure they translated everything correctly LOL"
1,"A very interesting subject, very well put together."

0,"My daughter likes it and she's 3 years old. I thought it was kind of noisy and confusing for her age, so I try to steer her to something else."
1,really like it
1,Ive been binge watching alot of series shows and this is one of the best.  Too bad ive run out of episodes.  Anxiously awaiting the next episode!
1,very entertaining and kept my attention looking forward to season4
0,"I am a huge Jane Austen fan and also enjoy P.D. James and read Death Comes to Pemberley. I so looked forward to the Masterpiece Theater version of the book - recorded all three hours and then sat down for an enjoyable marathon. About 15 minutes (make that 10 minutes) into the first episode, I stopped watching and have since deleted the episodes. I will not be purchasing the DVD's. The casting of Elizabeth was just wrong. Where was our &#34;loveliest, dearest Elizabeth&#34; with fine eyes, a lively wit and light step. I admit that this is not an intelligent critique of the series, of course, as I did not watch it. If you can get past the casting of Elizabeth, as I could not, you may enjoy these DVD's. I will contine to watch my Jennifer Ehle, Keira Knightly and Elizabeth Garve versions of Pride & Prejudice."
1,"Really enjoyed watching, and keeping up with the family!  Very well written"
1,Great
1,"Timothy Oliphant, Ian McShane, Brad Dourif, what is there  not to like?  Only problem is not all the seasons are free.  I found the others at the library, though.  One of the best tv shows ever made, don't miss it!"
1,I hate the Zelena baby thing...but every other story line is awesome.
1,This show has an exceptional cast and group of writers. I'm never disappointed!
1,"In my opinion this is one of the best series HBO made. Even though they have made a lot of amazing shows. I would highly recommend watching this show and then visiting Deadwood,  South Dakota."
1,Very nice.
1,typical Micheal Bay movie.
1,"One of the most original and thrilling series ever! Once you start watching, you will be hooked!"
1,BRING IT
1,A true edge of the seat thriller!
1,A break from the carnage of most<br />poductions with a good animal story<br />from another land.
1,It's was funny haha ha h
1,Good series
1,"Loved it!  These movies are a thrill ride of entertainment.  Sad that Paul passed on though,  which was handled amazingly well within the movie. Very moving tribute."
1,I caught myself laughing out loud and tears in my eyes during wax session.
1,AAA+++
1,Predictable
1,"A friend suggested this movie to me with the caveat that no one particular part of the movie was great but overall, when all the parts are combined, it turns out to be an incredible movie!"
1,Excellent
1,Word World!
1,Great show
1,Adam Carolla is the man.
1,Love this show. Season much more edgier
1,was engrossed for the duration and even watched it twice.
1,Loved it! We want more!
1,good
1,Now it is clear why my nephew after 8 yr  has spent the last 2 yrs trying to clean all of this out of his brain. The United States of America dose far to little for all of its veteran
1,Beautiful story!
1,Very entertaining
0,Charged me twice as well. Very frustrating. Als didn't get a refund.
1,Interesting characters and it is a good depiction of New York hustle for fame and miney
1,Entertaining and educational videos that my 12 year old naturalist loves to watch again and again!
0,Hard to follow
1,"Either you like Larry's bathroom humor or you do not.  I do.  If you like it, you will enjoy this standup comedy show... It's hard to believe ANYONE could listen to this without laughing.  I've seen Larry do slightly better, but this is really good."
1,"Wonderful, intense well written series. Love it."
1,Good clean comedy ... reminds me of the Monkeys and their hilarious hi jinks !!
1,Love it!!
1,Creative!  Cute love story with a twist
1,Wonderfully entertaining. Timothy Oliphant and the rest of the cast are all wonderful to watch.
1,Excellent.  Loved Bill Nighy.
1,Funny very true
1,"relevant zeitgeist, engaging storytelling by two masters of dance."
1,"I really enjoyed it.  I really think I could watch it again.  Assuming much of the move was based on historical information and combining it with a lasting love story, made it a winner.  Having said that, some parts it seemed were a little too unrealistic like wandering/drinking, in  the streets and bars alone in a  country that was just conquered and the local people in need of money, seem like a little too hollywood, for lack of a better word."
1,Need time to see if this is as engaging as The Walking Dead. Big shoes to fill.
1,Best series ever made. Great acting plus amazing plot.
0,poor
1,The kids love Backyardigans!! They watch it constantly and the playback stays clear and consistent throughout the whole episode.  Will continue watching.
1,Interesting plots and great characters.  Enjoyable show.
1,This is a must see thriller.
1,Hate that it ended!!
1,Easy to follow and a very good workout for mind and body!
1,"I watched this on the recommendation of Kimberly Guilfoyle from &#34;The Five&#34; and I was not disappointed.  I thought the acting was great, the story line a little bit out there (would that really happen in real life) and it made me laugh a lot.  I must have really liked it because I wanted more and now I have to wait for Season 2.  Bummer!"
1,Great old western show! Just as I remembered it as a kid.
1,Always enjoy all of Clint Eastwood's movies!  This one is especially good!
1,I really enjoyed the first season.
1,"Touching story about real people making it through life.  Definitely dark humour.  Acted well, and I understand ad libbed well.  Enjoyed the performances by all the actors.  Would recommend."
1,Great show! Can't wait to see more.
1,good show
1,always have like Andy and this show
0,ugh. Hardly worth the time to rate.
1,RELEASE SEASON FIVE !!!
1,Great program that fills the gap left by the ending of Hill Street Blue's most 20 year's ago.
1,"Blows away Season 1. Things are getting serious. Interesting take on the alien invasion paradigm. How do you defeat an enemy who's basically homo superior, especially after the peaceful leadership is lost and the new BMOC is ready wreak havoc on the world."
1,Disappointed overall - definitely not what I expected out of such an outstanding cast...
1,"After reading the Hiaasen book (Strip Tease), I was curious about the movie version of the story. While I believe that any movie version cannot reflect favorably all of the background and details of its book form, this movie, in particular did not weave the plot together seamlessly (coherently). If you are not seduced by the visions of the lovely topless Demi Moore, or the Burt Reynold's whacky interpretation of Congressman Dave Dilbeck, you will not find this film compelling. I really think this is about a 2.5."
1,Good movie. Gives you a historical perspective of the life and times of St. Francis of Asssi. Recommended.
1,"I have been a fan of Wanda Sykes for a long time; this stand up does not disappoint.  It is somewhat dated, but she is as fresh as ever."
1,Entertaining--short episodes held my attention.
0,So boring. My six year old was not amused. Nor was I.
1,"Excellent movie, the end is a heart wrencher"
1,I really like this video. It gets the heart rate up and is easy to follow. I do the sun salutations with this regularly and it keeps me on track.
1,"Great show, we totally relate, and enjoy being able to laugh at the things that most families experience, no one is exempt!"
1,"The movie content was good; then ending left me wanting more! Good movie for teenagers and a female audience. True to the book, the acting of the parents was right on to the story. It's a cute movie and book. Slow at some parts. Nothing amazing."
1,Friend recommended and as a guy I was skeptical.  Hilarious!
1,"A little slow, but I do get why."
1,Fun movie. Sometimes it's fun to watch these movies as an adult.
1,Nice to see a female lead scientist.
1,I should have watched this when it was on the regular series but glad I had a chance to see it now.
1,#FEELTHEBERN
1,I love this workout.
1,Wonderfully imaginative and entertaining.
1,Great show I watched with my daughter.
1,Good
1,Great series. Marathoned all six episodes. Can't wait for season two.
1,"Really hard to watch, but also very well done.  We should all ban together and boycott circus elephants and the exploitation of elephants in general."
1,Loved it!  Such subtle plot building and an impeccable cast!  Made us want for more.
0,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I haven't read the book, but I sure hope it's better than the movie was. Judy Blume has an excellent reputation as a YA writer, so I would expect more of her than what came through in this movie. I found it contrived and cliched, as well as inaccurate. The Jewish funeral at the beginning, for the protagonist's father, was ridiculously inaccurate. Kaddish is recited at the graveside, not Shema. The Native American ritual was likewise built on stereotype and very little knowledge of authentic tradition. &#34;Wolf,&#34; whom &#34;Tiger&#34; meets just too conveniently pops up at very contrived moments, and his father being in the hospital is just too precious and absurd. The characters are one-dimensional and cardboard. Even the small touches (a young girl climbs up a mountain in New Mexico and doesn't rip her jeans or get her hands dirty?), are poorly done.<br /><br />I can see where the end has healing and moving qualities. Perhaps my standards are a little high, as I am an adult and the movie was meant for teenagers or &#34;tween&#34;-agers. But any age group deserves the respect of accuracy when depicting religious traditions and rituals, and some complexity in the characters."
0,This movie is just absolutely horrible. I am pretty much down to watch any movie until the end but we literally could not finish it.
1,All-star cast and great story! Spring for HD version. Every time I see this I want to go take the bar and be a lawyer. Marissa Tomei is still as hot as ever. Matthew McConaughey is a brilliant actor.
1,last episode had a nice little twist!
1,"An excellent documentry with a rare behind the scenes of Studio Ghibli working on a feature film. Miyazaki's thoughts on the 21st century and his casual musings were very interesting.<br /><br />If you like anything from ghibli, miyazaki or are an animation fan at all I can't recommend this enough."
1,Feel good movie.
1,A stirring account of three Palestinian gay men struggling to maintain their cultural heritage along with their sexual orientation.
1,"This series is so well done and fun to watch.  I love the leads but the supporting actors are terrific too, especially Chris.  The story is compelling (meaning, you want to know what happens next) and really a pleasure to watch."
1,Great movie
1,"Love Love this show.. anytime you end up saying, OH, NO..while watching it is a good show in my book"
1,interesting
1,Great show! Wish that there was a season 2!
1,Vince never puts out a bad more. Hilarious!!
1,It' a Festavus miracle!
0,Cliched. She screws around without pill. he forgets condom. who needs this?
0,Confusing and far fetched
1,LIGHT and DARK comedy .... I know that sounds like a contradiction of terms ... but in this case it fits!
1,Very entertaining.
1,"High quality, well thought out, magnificently filmed, brilliantly clever."
0,Meh
1,This is a real movie  verygood
0,Gets contrived and simplistic by this season
0,"I'm shocked this movie was actually released.  Boring, corny, and forced."
0,Silly!!!
1,Great show.  Too bad it wasn't picked up for another season.  Mistake HBO.
1,good
1,Amazing!
0,Did not care for this movie
1,Good ending..
1,Great movie! Sets a great tone and mood.
1,Contained i9nformation that I did not previously know but was a little boring
1,Gets better and better.
1,"The movie wasn't bad but I don't think it was as good as the first two, but that is just my opinion."
1,"I like old western movies. Some of the newer ones, not so much!"
1,Great show
1,"Just what I expected, mild story line with a lot of action..."
0,Good actors.  No storyline.
1,Very excellent
1,Another Jack Bauer unrewarded triumph!
1,"This is a great movie, the 3 hours just fly by!"
0,Very very very light comedy for adults only
1,I am hooked for these kind of films I hope that amazon provides more similar films in the future.
1,"Refreshingly honest film. Billed as a comedy, but surprisingly much more poignant."
1,Great learning show for children
1,The acting could have been better but the story line kept my attention.  The music was excellent!!
1,"A bit on the predictable side, but over all an entertaining movie. It certainly kept our teenage foreign exchange students engaged."
1,love housewives
1,great show
1,Loved it
1,Interesting and short. Made for TV but I didn't mind
1,"Brutally true, a look at what reality would certainly be"
1,Really enjoyed!
1,Great storyline and acting.  Gritty and realistic!
1,Such a great movie with lots of laughs!
1,Sneaky Pete has the makings of a good show and I would like to see more!
1,Love Star Trek
1,"Just what you want from an 83 year old horror movie!  Popcorn, after midnight, black & white.......  The Monster Walks!!!!!"
1,How very cool is this series!
1,Too dark<br />Too loud<br />Too atmospheric<br />Too bad because the first two seasons were superb. And season three ends just as we get to the Buffalo Bill story.<br />I'm disappointed we'll never see that segment. I think we would have if the didn't go over the top in season three.
1,"We've watched three episodes so far and we're enjoying it.  The incorporation of actual historical events into the storyline has made it interesting, and we like the pace of the dialogue in that you really have to be attentive to not miss something.  So far so good; we'll see how it develops."
0,"The movie was very good until the end, which sucked."
1,to repetitive
1,In it's class--entertainment--I find it engaging.
1,I for hooked on this and HAD to see each season.  Most series do well in the first two seasons and then begin to enter into a slow death.
0,"I mean, it was so FLAT.  It was predictable, with lots of cutesy moments for the kids which were utterly unnecessary... it was like there were two story line, one serious, one DISNEY.  And they didn't meld well, and they basically destroyed each other.<br /><br />Plus...JAR JAR BINKS.... Will SOMEONE please put a blaster to back of his stupid head and end our pain???"
1,Another excellent Masterpiece Theater series!  Our only problem is we bought and watched the first Season (without commercial interruption...&#34;YES!!!&#34;) in three nights....now we have to wait and watch for when the series begins again in 2016!  Great characters and character development...with lots of &#34;turns&#34; in the script that are unexpected!
1,"Good for a few laughs but very much a lowbrow comedy. Some are going to love its cliches and taking things a bit too far, others will find it offensive in its disrespectful tone."
0,"Sorry Mr. Bridges, couldn't watch more than 20 min.  ugh."
0,"Poorly acted, poorly filmed, poorly edited.  Loud, boring, predictable.  Nostalgia is the only reason to explain the positive reviews.  Watched it as an adult with my wife, first time seeing it.  9 year old daughter tolerated it.  Wife and I hated it.  It's terrible.  Did I mention it's loud?  Stupid and noisy.  It's a lazy movie that tries to get laughs exploiting the fat kid and the asian, and the Mexican maid.  Beyond this, it's just too boring to keep writing about."
1,The story line is getting poorly written.
1,Great movie! Everyone would benefit from this story
0,Didn't care of for the movie.  Movie was poorly done.
1,I liked the plot but had a hard time with the main character. His acting is pretty flat but I wanted to see the outcome. The ending was a disappointment. Seemed like they never really finished the script & just slapped on a random ending.
1,"Finally a tv series you can't the guess the end.  Dynamic cast, great locations and only one person died and not on camera.  We want more"
1,I am a huge walking dead fan and this looks great!! Character building is what keeps u watching and they have done a great job of it in episode one. Plus they took something that is currently an epidemic that is really killing kids worse than ever before (heroin) and incorporated  it into the storyline. Nice. Very multidimensional.
1,"Awesome show, after the end of the Sopranos and the Wire this keep me in tune to HBO."
1,Really funny and entertaining.
1,Greatly exciting and stimulating.  It is logical and informative. It would be a tremendous evangelism tool for a soul winner.
1,Chick flickðŸ˜Š
1,Great play
1,"I love this show.  It's funny,  geeky and full of exciting adventures.  Sometimes it's like everyone else gets injured or killed and only sg1 makes it out alive... But still it's great. The other bad thing about this is that they canceled the stargate franchise altogether.  Wish it was still going on!"
1,"A subtle message in this movie that doesn't become apparent to the end. When I got to the end, I said, WOW, that's a pretty great move."
1,I really enjoy watching Downtown Abbey.
1,"Keeping things going, even with a rocky start"
1,Loved this movie! I would recommend. Very inspirational.
1,"Good story, interesting characters.  Sometimes too much violence.<br /><br />Why have several stories I've watched for free on Amazon Prime now available only for a charge?  This includes Justified, Primeval and Defiance."
1,My kids favorite show!!!
1,"every chance I get i watch from the beginning- I have always wanted to see this program-love the scenery, the dress, the attitudes of the people and the story-AWESOME"
1,One of the greatest shows ever cancelled!!
1,This fills in the blanks between Captain America 1 and 2. Very fun season
1,The mother of all reality shows.  Still holds up.  Interesting how it has changed over the years.  Great Fun.
1,Great show
1,Best Show ever made. I'll watch this show loads more.
1,Best season yet! LOVED IT!
1,"Good show, hope it keeps going"
1,Good movie
1,"quite predictable.Heart-warming for dog lovers in a dog loves man way, but not deeply engaging for me."
1,I love the books and most of the movies. This particular one happens to be my favorite.
1,I love Mr. Rogers.  Thank you for making this available.
1,Magnificent!!
0,Changing my review to 1 star. After a few months use the end near connection is splitting open!!!!
1,Great movie!!!! The new James Bond!!!! LOL
1,I liked this movie a lot.
1,Loved every single minute
1,Loved this season great action from start to finish looking forward yo season 2
1,Cute - my 5 year old loved the season
1,Brings back a good feeling of Nostalgia.
1,awesome movie
1,"It's an engaging enough series. A bit too violent for me, so I couldn't give it five stars."
1,I loved this film. Some of the scenes and music are a bit odd (such is Japanese Style:) But the message and connected love that is transended by food (Italian food). A different way of looking at a friendship and romatic relationship and how it flows. 2 thumbs up :-)
1,"Love it!  For some reason the Cello pulls me in.  The songs, too.  The story is sad but captivating."
1,Great exciting series I hope there are more to come.
1,FANTASTIC SHOW
1,Great show!  A must see.
0,Terrible
1,Being a strong fan of the original &#34;Star Trek&#34;....never thought I'd watch this Season...very very good.....I really liked the<br />&#34;Evil Skin&#34;...really touch my soul....made me think!
0,"Not so much a comedy, as a dark drama. These actors are extremely funny, but this movie was not roles for them to showcase that talent."
1,Loved it. Going to be sad when I complete the 5th & final season!
1,"This is a fun, very humorous, love story that was overlooked by the critics.  Set mainly within Provence, France at a beautiful chateau with scenes from London, Russell Crowe does a great job as an actor.  He is a funny, outrageous, smart, egocentric romantic who finds himself at a crossroad between his business life in London and a laid back style in Provence.  He is supported by Albert Finney, Marion Cotillard, Archie Punjabi, and Didier Bourdon, all of whom do a wonderful job.  The story swaps between the past and the present, giving impetus as to why two people who forgot they met as children, grow up in different cultures, and fall in love.  I rarely watch a movie more than once, but this one I enjoy watching it again and again with my family and wife."
1,"Really Weird, but good nonetheless."
1,Great for a kids semi scary animated flick...
1,"I love it, I need to re-watch it again as it give out so much information. I learned a lot too."
1,A very good improvement since season 1.
1,Very touching and inspiring. A testament to the value of every life.
1,It was entertaining. Not a waste of time.
0,"boring, couldn't understand the dialog.  Shut off the movie after 45 minutes."
1,A very interesting celebrity. Bold smart and courageous.
1,my family love this.
1,More of the same hilarious hijinks from the crew of Archer. More excited about next season than I would have thought possible.
1,"Very promising show, excellent casting."
1,This is an awesome program based on the railroad being built to the Pacific.
1,Cenk speaks the truth!  TYT is an excellent source for real news! This movie is very inspiring and makes you think about who is funding your news source.
1,More please!
1,WATCHED THE SERIES WILL WATCH AGAIN AT ITS START
1,Grows on you as they plot develops.
1,"Predicable, but cute."
1,Excellent
1,Good
1,A touch of The original Disney with something new added.
0,Unimaginative dialogue & writing.  I couldn't even finish the entire episode because I was so bored!
1,"I've seen this movie probably 100 times, Denzel is one of my favorite actors of all time, and this movie is by far my favorite movie ever. Every time I watch it, I find one bit of foreshadowing or some other detail that I have never caught before. Each time watching it is as good as the first time if not better. Highly recommended."
1,Good to pass time
1,"smart, ethical, timely.<br />Very well acted,<br />Unusually smart scripts"
1,great series i love watching it
1,OK but not worthy of more than 3 stars on my opinion.
1,I loved this series so much that I started watching it all over again from the beginning. And I am enjoying it even more now than the first time. Looking forward to starting season 2
1,GETTING 2 B 2 MUCH B/S
1,Very good war show.  Typical Hollywood though in many areas.
1,"Great movie. Unique, realistic, and artsy at the same time."
1,Great series
1,AN EXCELLENT MOVIE ONE OF THE BEST IN MY OPINION THANKS
1,Excellent movie!
1,"Great history and story!  Not too gory like some war movies, but you get the idea.  Lots of cameos, too.  Be sure to look at the credits."
1,Just keeps getting better and better!
1,Love veggietales
1,"Such an intense show! It has great plot lines. And the lead actor, I've seen him before but always in secondary roles. He was a perfect choice."
1,Very funny
1,Excellent movie!!
1,It was enjoyable.
1,Typical british comedy. Enjoyable
1,"Silly fun that occasionally trends toward smart.  It strikes me as trying a little too hard to parallel House of Cards but Julia Louis Dreyfus is definitely enjoying herself, especially given all the cursing she gets to do via HBO.  Anna Chlumsky is actually the actress/character I'm most enjoying...when I'm not remembering her as a child star opposite Macauley Culkin in My Girl!"
1,An really enjoying the show - I missed the seasons when on tv so I am catching up for the new season 6
1,Loved it
1,great series
1,This is the only show that even comes close to competing for my attention. I've watched both seasons on prime art last 6 times and I'm still amazed at the level of detail that this show provides.  A+
1,Awesome documentary
1,Favorite show!
1,Good.
1,"This season has been a roller coaster of ups and downs, who to trust, and even the plot is much more diverse. Every week I tune in waiting to see what merry twist is in store this week."
1,Good movie but not great.
1,"Nothing exceptional, just your standard loud noises and things jumping out at you."
1,"Story is warm, heartfelt, and relatable,  Gave it only 3 stars, however, because at times it was bit difficult to understand due to the strong British accents.  Also it moves a bit slowly."
1,Tatiana Maslany is amazing in the multiple roles she plays. Fast paced. Suspenseful.<br />Felix is a great counter point character.
1,"Great cast, great dialogue. Made me read the book. I hope they do the rest of the trilogy."
1,Wonderful actors and acting.
1,Amazing!
1,"This movie will make you become a keeper of the dead, just like its protagonist. It is a gorgeously directed, written, and acted movie. I literally gasped at how symbolic and subtle one shot was directed. But...it made me cry harder than any movie I've ever watched. I'm still glad I saw it because thoughtful, beautiful things should be seen even when it hurts. Recommended for people who enjoy movies like Heartlands (another British gem) and Bright Star."
1,Minnie driver is awesome as always!
1,IN LOVE WITH THE SHOW!!!
1,I would recommend. It was filmed just prior to 2000 in France. It's a bit different presentation than I'm used to but found the whole idea of gleaning really very interesting. Hearing about the laws they have in France governing it was fascinating.
1,This movie really highlights the reality of what a dad misses out on when the Mom thinks it's best to &#34;protect&#34; dad from reality. Loving your kids is about knowing your kids and this movie depicts a father in his retirement years trying to engage with his adult children after years of working to provide for them.  I enjoyed it!
1,Great Show!
1,Thanks
1,Love this show!!!
1,"It is getting VERY interesting.  As usual, Halle is EXCELLENT!  The acting is superb and the plot line interesting for a basic SciFi program.  The exploration of human interfaces with people, places, and circumstance.  I salute the entire production company on this program!"
0,Lost interest in it within the first five minutes.
1,"As I have commented before: A superb television SciFi series, with excellent writing and acting. Stargate SG1 is my second, all time, favorite TV SciFi series, only slightly behind Star Trek Deep Space Nine. This will be my second &#34;trip&#34; with SG1 and my fourth &#34;trip&#34; on DS9."
1,LIKED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
1,Love it!
1,When I found 24 on Amazon Prime I decided to watch it from the beginning. I used to watch an episode every now then. Now it makes sense after finishing the first season.<br />I love the idea of 24 hours in 24 episodes. Will watch the rest of it when I have time. It is really entertaining.
1,One of my top 5 favorite shows of all time!
1,Excellent ... well done.
1,Well written!! very funny
1,Love the Golden Girls.
1,Twists and turns
1,"This course is absolutely spectacular. Unfortunately, for this clip titled &#34;How to Use Wide Angle Lenses,&#34; the selected segment is one which focuses on how NOT to use wide angle lenses. Still valuable, but there are more appropriate clips that would have supported this title."
1,"This is a very slow moving movie. If you have a couple of hours to relax and enjoy the amazing animation and sweet storyline, it's well worth it."
1,Fantastic!!
1,"I liked it. Never a dull moment, lots of action"
1,So many twists and changes that I didn't expect.
1,Was great
1,Great movie!!!
1,Good
1,"This only got 3 stars but it's great if you're a fan of scifi. Super advanced technology, good action, and Mila is hot. /thread."
1,fun movie. well done.
1,Best series ever!!  Can't believe it was canceled.
1,"it was cute, but not 5 star. i injoyed it"
1,Baby loves it.
0,"I normally enjoy Keira Knightly's acting. However, this movie was slow, and rather boring. I only made it through the first fifteen to twenty minutes of it. Sorry Keira."
1,Worth watching.
1,Good
1,My kids love this show.
1,Very touching.
1,"Good war movie.  I liked it.  Story made sense.  Actors acted, director directed, nothing annoying about<br />effects, not too preachy.  Avoided most traps these things fall into and moved along well enough to keep my interest."
1,Good show
1,Stop the smart meters.  You are deceived.  Watch this video for why and take action to protect your privacy and health.
1,I haven't found an episode yet that I am disappointed in. They are are all informative and the images are truly fantastic!
1,"The realism and action what makes 24, for my Wife and I the best show ever. Jack Bauer is the ultimate resource for getting the job done with honesty and integrity."
1,Enjoyable light fair. Have your tissues ready. Based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. Nothing else needs to be said.
1,"Not what I expected @all. Great story, scary & heartwarming @ the same time. Just like love should be!"
1,This was done like an old mobster movie which would have been fine but the music was horrible.
1,"Well acted and well crafted. This film takes on a real life issue, with compassion and honesty. Beyond the typical Hollywood version of a subject matter such as this. Expand your Universe and see this sweet &#34;little&#34; film."

1,"Entertaining, but more of the same with not a lot of new ideas."
1,Not a bad flick.  Was certainly entertaining.
1,Absolutely amazing! There is so much going on and is all told so well.
1,Ok
1,"My 20 year old daughter LOVED this movie - very well done, deep, enlightening, inspirational and exceptional acting."
1,"The story was so well-told that it hardly seemed to be just under 2hrs long.  It's a very accurate, unbiased portrayal of our public education system (unless, of course, you're the teachers union). It'll leave you fired up and angry."
0,I watched this because it was free for Prime members. It was truly godawful and the CGI turtles looked utterly ridiculous.
0,"Got curious after watching the new Hitman movie. Good, but the new version brings more action & a strong female lead."
1,"interesting, tells about various landmarks in different countries and some of there history"
1,Love these 2 hotties!
1,How can you go wrong with spongebob square pants? That sponge is an institution.
1,"I loved this as a kid and my kids now love it, as well.  Good stuff!"
1,Good family movie!
1,My 2 year old granddaughter seems to love it. It keeps her pretty engaged.
1,need season 3 but can't afford $2.00 per episode
0,"I went into this knowing expecting a silly nonsense movie but didn't care since I was in the mood for it.  Sadly, this was so unimaginative that I couldn't finish watching it.  I do want the dress Sofia was wearing at the beginning of the movie though - stunning."
1,Series keeps one wanting to watch more. Fiction and non fiction accounts from the beginnings of the boardwalk icon!
1,Brilliant.  Wish there was more.
1,Loved It!!!
1,I cannot wait for season 2!  This show is so funny (and engaging and endearing!) and left me wanting more as soon as I finished it!
1,... The Glades has a magical quality which leaves you feeling as if you had lived in Florida all your life.
1,only watched one president
1,"Interesting number of characters, various plots evolving."
1,great show!
0,Waste of time.
1,good little series
1,Pretty good
1,Great show in the spirit of Stargate SG-1
1,"Never a dull moment, always on the edge of my seat. The most captivating series I have seen to date, never a disappointment!!"
1,Good funny!
0,Love the book and the black & white movie but could not get into this one and turned it off after 15 minutes.
1,"This was one of my favorite sci-fi shows! Loved Neelix, Janeway and 7 of 9!"
1,The authenticity of the period is very depicted. The story follows history well.
1,As good as season 1
1,"Wonderful story lines, and acting is superb. I can't stop watching!"
1,"This is my girlfriend's favorite film, and she had me watch it with her. Some hours later, we have yet another thing we agree on. A wonderful movie."

1,What an excellent series!  I am so sad we're up to the last season.
1,good
1,Has
1,"My 4 year old son loves the original cartoon and we had to buy the new updated version. He loves it! It's adorable, he loves it so much, he can watch it on repeat for days. Momma loves it too!"
1,Loved this show...at times I even laughed out loud  Happy to discover a really great new series
1,It's entertaining in a just passing time sort of way. It certainly is better quality than many of this type of productions.
1,"A little too early to tell, but it looks like the characters, like those of the original series (ourtside of Mashonne (sp), will be doing heroically stupid things, and all around will die horrible deaths...except them. Why can't they be a normal group of people doing &#34;smart&#34; things to stay out of trouble. That would be an original show!"
1,"Not as good as the Mentalist, but entertaining none the less."
1,I and my wife enjoyed it and watched with a big interest in spite of occasional audio problems like unsynchronized audio and video or even one time complete loss of audio.
1,"This show is something else. Wow, Bold, funny, crude, and entertaining. How the heck do the writers come up with this stuff. Can't wait to see what happens in season two."
1,Enjoyable!
1,My kids love this
1,I loved the series.
1,Hilarious. I haven't watched it since it first came out.
1,Well written.
1,Great costumes and setting but in general a little weak.
0,Storyline did not hold my interest
1,Great account of an important pilgrimage.
1,The show is amazing and it need more viewers
1,Excellent movie.  The little boy is so cute!  It makes you wonder about the after life!  At movie!
1,"Literally the best movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />It is a masterpiece, from the cinematography to the acting, to the plot. My next best/favorite movies are a toss up between the original Star Wars trilogy, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Harry Potter series. All frivolous compared to this movie. This one shows what CAN be done with a master film maker at the helm.<br /><br />It is not a movie you will want to watch repeatedly or often. About every ten to fifteenth years might be right. I've seen it twice, once when it first came out, in the theater, and later on DVD. And that is enough for me. It is a &#34;heavy hit,&#34; but a movie everyone should see at least once."
1,Fantastic show. I hated seeing it end. I wish they would still be producing
1,"This is so funny and Gary Owens, is off the chain, I laughed so hard, so much, my side hurt. we need more of this humor. :-). To funny!"
0,"Though I like the actors a lot and am a history buff, I just don't like this.  There isn't a compelling storyline.  It's very predictable as things are telegraphed way ahead of time.  The violence is gratuitously graphic.  I know the era and the characters would be violent but it seems that many of the scenes are used not to move the story on but to impress the audience with the special effects...spattering blood, etc. Yeah, this guy got killed, you gained nothing by drawing it out.  The story isn't that interesting and the characters aren't likable so why should I keep watching beyond the four episodes I gave it to get interesting."
1,Excellent show... My fav
1,I enjoyed the mix of humor and a serious subject with two emotionally flawed characters. I just did not care for the ending which I found weak.
1,this show is addicting!
0,Voices are ok. Lack of sparkle to the stage design nd costumes.  A rather dark presentation of what is usually light hearted.
1,So hope they bring Jack back....again!
1,"Come on its Voltron, of course 5 stars."
1,Really good!
0,"Nothing like the original, very disappointed.  Thankfully it had good action sequences"
1,"Frank is outstanding.  For a short little guy, he really has HUGE talent.  Unfortunately, like most comedians that rely almost entirely on their impersonations, if the impersonation misses, the routine falls flat.  Luckily for us, that is VERY rare with Frank!!"
1,"Very insightful and informative. I've always heard of it, and thought it was hard...but had no idea how bad it was."
1,"Quirky, fun & funny!!"
1,Good show that uses too much profanity.
1,Drama! Lots of fun! Totally recommended.
0,Terrible movie.
1,Much more interesting this year!
1,It's interesting
1,My 3yr olds love it
1,Great show
0,Couldn't even make it through the first episode it was so boring.
1,"Excellent show, truley exciting."
0,Crude humor. Not interested.
1,love it
1,Very good
1,I liked this movie.  It is based on a true story from the mid 1750's in Pennsylvania.  The movie did not have a wide theatrical release so I did not expect a lot from the production.  The acting and production quality was much better than I expected for an independent release without a sizeable budget.  I am not getting into the &#34;politics&#34; of the historical events but appreciated the faith based portrayal of the immigrant family who left their home in Europe to practice their faith in a new land free from religious persecution.
1,"A blast to watch. It has humor, a bit of sadness, and a great story - this should appeal to many. I don't want to reveal the plot, but I will say its about a secret society that works to save the world, only invites &#34;exceptional&#34; youngsters in when old members die, and there's a mad-man out to destroy the world as we know it - and the new class has to learn and deal with this threat as current members are being killed. This movie has<br />1) a bit of Get Smart, although its much more intelligent than that (and I loved Get Smart when I was a kid);<br />2)a bit of Bond, but it is much more self deprecating than that; and<br />3) even a bit of Justice League thrown in, but much more sinister than that.<br /><br />A great Sunday afternoon film with great actors taking on interesting and well developed characters."
1,"Nuanced, engaging and thoughtful.  Critiques our xenophobic tendencies as only Spielberg knows how to do."
1,Good Movie! !
1,I really enjoy The Good Wife episodes.
1,"I like this.  It has a distinctly adult flavor--given its sexual aspect.  But it doesn't go over the top with it.  It's entertaining enough that I kept watching despite the feeling that, at times, I might overdose on the sweetness.  Just as I felt I was approaching saturation, the REAL people showed up.  You know.  The ones with warts--just like the rest of us.  That was a relief.  I must admit it did have just a bit of that &#34;stiffness&#34; I always feel at the start of a new series.  But given how much I liked it, I am expecting GREAT things when the actors are feeling more at home in their roles.  And I anticipate it will not disappoint."
1,Last season was better but it still intrigues.
1,saw it in 1962.... meant a whole lot more today .. still the same issues abound throughout ..
1,Loved it! Can't wait to see another episode!!
1,Excellent character development.
1,good show hope they make more
1,ENJOYED!
1,Good
1,"well written performed, directed and filmed"
1,Best show ever!
1,"Like the storyline. Some, not all, of the acting is a little over the top. Overall, I really enjoy the show."
1,This is some of the best writing for a television series that I have watched!  It is gripping television.
1,"Good writing and all, but it brought up to many feeling about our own experience"
1,This is actually my wife's rating.  She really loved it.  I did not watch it but she wanted me to write this and say that it is a very good show....
1,Excellent!
1,It is definitely a fun show.  Reminiscent of Firefly.  it will be interesting to see how the characters develop.
1,Expertly crafted animation and storytelling. Great for all ages.
1,Cried through the last half of season five.  Great!  Wish there were more per season.
1,One of his favorites
1,It was incredible I'd give more than five stars if there were more I loved the movie
1,Another great comedy/horror calssic with a tongue in cheek approach to the old genre of monster movies with a unique twist that kept me watching until the bitter end!  This is obviously an 80's version of a Vincent Price 3D Horror classic from the 50's that scared the pants off many!
1,my three yr old grand daughter lovesssss it
0,Blah
1,Awsome Show
1,"Great ensemble cast. Feel good movie, but not soppy."
1,"This movie was awesome. It has a very unique plot, something I've never seen before. It's definitely worth checking out!"
1,This show is addicting!!  And there are 7 seasons to watch on Amazon Prime!!
1,Nice show
1,Great movie
1,Great movie.
1,i love this show
1,"This series left me hanging in many ways , a little too British, I was confused by a lot of their lingo. Disjointed plot but some of it was enjoyable even so."
1,excellent
1,"Good movie, unexpected ending, which is always a good thing! Charlize is great in it of course!"
1,"Fantastic Film, everyone should watch it."
1,"I thought it was pretty good. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Kind of a slow start but after it finally start goin, it was good."
1,Hot Viking love him.....Wonderful series and much actual history to be learned if your so inclined. Fabulously portrayed interesting characters whom you either love or feel great disdain for then quickly all is changed and one begins to fall for all the characters portrayed. Very well done....
1,Why not make season 7 prime also. They want to charge for the last season and I don't think is fear.
1,Fabulous for kids with an interest in the world around them.  Wish it was still in production!!
1,Just as I remembered it. Definitely a classic.
1,"I love this show,"
1,"Great action. Vivid and graphic violence make the movie a real seat squirmer. This movie and others like it should educate the public on what our military goes through, whether we agree or not, for us and make the ultimate sacrifice so we can go about our merry lives mostly without a care. Thank the goodness that exists, for the most part, our soldiers won't have to face that kind of agony and violence depicted in this excellent flick."
1,Hubby & I love watching True Blood.  It's become a nightly ritual after the kids go to bed.  Can't wait for Season 6!
1,Great spy thriller.  Hoffmann's performance as a world-weary German intelligence agent is spot on.
1,I'm looking forward to the next episode.
1,Good story and good acting. Season 3 please. ðŸ˜Š
1,"Such an accomplished, amazingly strong woman.  Susan Oliver is one of my favorite actresses of all time, A true pioneer in so many ways. Classic beauty that rivaled the best Hollywood had to offer, on the Big Screen or Television. She will stand the test of time.  I remember watching TV back when I was young in the 70's and always wondering who this beauty was, I had such a huge crush and she was so prolific.  Now 52 I am now rediscovering Susan all over again. The bravery she possessed being only the 4th woman ever to fly solo across the Atlantic took nerves of steel and courage beyond belief. So talented!!  I wish she was still alive so I could tell her, but she's looking down and knows. A great role model to all!! Susan set her mark and stuck to it! Great documentary for anyone who treasures the golden years of Television.  George Pappy did a fabulous job!!  Sincerely, John Ferro in FLA"
1,They carefully did their research on each generation of vampire to make a hilarious documentary.
1,It missed some key elements from the book. Still aight though.
1,"silly story, cheap action"
1,It has a slow start but then picks up toward the middle - end.
0,"I have watched trailers and clips of this and have always had a desire to watch. So I ordered season 1 epi 1.... But it was a lot scarier than I expected.  I was unable to watch ;(. With that I have to say, I'm a Christian and I'm not desensitized like I used to be!!  I love medevil era type movies, but I don't like scary stuff at all!! I've heard awesome reviews from friends I just could not watch myself!!  I'm sure the authors and illustrators are very talented!!!"
1,Different but fun to watch
1,Great series!  Love the characters and era.
1,Not as good as the first... still enjoyed it ...no John Cusack either...
1,Superb and awesome series!
0,Boring!
1,Not bad entertaining enough like it

1,Amazing show I just love it great story line and the endings are usually really good to!!!
1,A fun movie and a good story.
1,Great movie
1,"This is an incredibly well-written, artfully done show. It is thrilling, suspenseful, and eerily beautiful. However, it is not for the faint of heart (I &#34;watched&#34; several scenes with my hand over my eyes). The acting is superb and unlike anything I have ever seen before on network tv."
1,Pac Man is a remarkable man and fighter. I love watching him fight and this is a great documentary.
1,Great
1,Ok
1,"Excellent actors, and a lovely premise. But this could have been better. It was enjoyable, but light."
1,I love this show.
1,"This show is so funny! The characters are likable, too, which is a nice change from a lot of the new shows today."
1,Very entertaining
1,"Thoughts was a good movie, good acting and a very good story line"
1,It's great.
1,"Great movie, great story.  Apparently Sy is now dancing in the Carolinas.  I really enjoyed it, worth your time to watch."
1,I enjoyed it.
1,Excellent movie. It's the type of movie that is fun from start to end but makes you think about your own tolerance of others. Enlightening without having to be preachy.
1,Huge fan of survivor
1,The show is great even if you don't agree with every word.
1,Very funny. I binge watched the entire first season!
1,Great show. Im hooked!
1,We LOVE SpongeBob!!
1,"Funny, fresh, poignant at times. Not your ordinary series, and I like that!"
1,Very well directed movie.  We would definitely recommend it.
1,"Superb layered writing and acting. Bill Nighy and especially, Judy Davis, were superb."
1,Great story with very good casting.  Sorry to see it end.  Very current on news stories covered.
1,This show is stellar through and through! Can't wait for the full season!!
1,Okay season but may have gone on too long.
1,good story. learned some things
1,Awesome
1,Could be great..<br />Guess we'll see
1,It was ok
1,"Not many hangups with the show, except one - Tanya has got to mature, she is driving me nuts."
1,My 9 year old loves this show! Watching it every chance she gets.
1,"Awesome, great, and one of a kind."
0,Crazy movie.
0,This movie is great if you think being vulgar is funny.
0,"Thought it had bad acting, I couldn't watch it. Just my opinion though."
0,Thought some of the subject matter was fake.
0,Bad.  It's just bad.  Couldn't get through more than about 20 minutes.
1,"Amazing, still, after all this time. Robin Williams steals the show."
1,great movie
1,"I love the show and I can't always watch on day it comes out, so being able to watch on amazon is awesome and greatly convenient"
0,"had to shut it off after 20 minutes, because it was just going nowhere and making no sense to me..."
1,Awesone show..highly recommended
1,Excellant show!! Luv it.
1,enjoyed the show
1,"This was a fun and engaging series. The story line was far-fetched, but I enjoyed the ride. I would recommend to Prime users......it's a great rainy day distraction"
1,Keeps my four and a half year old engaged! It also gives us great craft ideas to do after every show!
1,"One of those shows that makes you think about subscribing to HBO, not that it's on anymore."
1,I loved this movie.. if you are a book lover or writer you will even love it more!<br />I just wish there was more of an end but isnt that the case with a lot of books and movies?
1,I gave this flick a 5 for it being unique and still interesting
1,Totally addicted.
1,The greatest of all time!
1,Incredible documentary details the patience and perseverance applied in the solving of one of art's enduring mysteries...and the solution provided seems the only logical answer!  Just how did Vermeer do it?
1,Funny!
1,"My 3-year-old son usually only likes scary things like Scooby Doo, and I know that's my fault but when I showed him one episode I never thought he would be obsessed with it.  Cut to about a month ago when we discovered Team UmiZoomi! He is obsessed! It is so educational and I never have to cringe while he's watching it.  Thank you Amazon Prime for providing this great show for my boy to watch!"
1,Love this show.  The twist and turns are never expected ahead of time which is great. I don't like guessing the outcome of a show because then I'm wasting time watching it.
1,The Original better then I remember.
1,Much better than expected based on the promo material ... Especially the photo
1,"The characters are interesting and the possibilities are......so as long as the writers keep coming up with new and creative paths, the actors for the most part carry on with their craft I will keep watching."
1,"A very god movie, 4 stars if in color 5 stars"
1,"After watching several seasons, the &#34;review&#34; of season 1 was interesting. I recall watching some of these but only developed and interest later."
1,"I read the late Philip K Dick's original novel the year I graduated from High School (1978) and have been waiting to reread it, but now that novel has been turned into a series for at least one season, I'll have to reread The Man in the High Castle before the season begins in November 2015.  From this pilot, I can see that many changes have been made, but they were necessary if the basic premise is to be presented as a series that might run multiple seasons.  Pop radio in this alternative 1962 sounds like from the 1940s in the Nazi-occupied portion of the former USA.  Thus, Rock and Roll never got going, and I suspect there will be no Beatlemania in this alternative timeline's 1964.<br /><br />Yes, and I sure hope I got caught in the Pacific States of America, which is the same way I felt after reading the novel so many years ago.  My teenage boys and I are looking forward to watching the coming season.  Nazi technology versus Japanese wisdom plus the Chinese I Ching should be a delightful secondary subplot, as we learn more about the Man in the High Castle and whether or not he can remain safe from the those who would like to see him silenced.  Guess who won World War II in the original novel, as determined by the I Ching.  We're looking forward to see what the producer will do with that plot element."
1,Kids enjoyed it.
1,Simply amazing
1,"What a surprising movie, I had never seen or heard of Adam Sandler in a serious role.  Tea Leoni plays a ditsy LA housewife, so different than Madam Secretary.  Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce are the real stars of the movie.  I was skeptical but thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
1,One of my favorites!
1,good movie.
1,"A no-brainer kind of movie, but full of action."
1,Very entertaining.
1,Fantastic show. The actors are great esp. John Goodman.
1,"This series is apparently hysterical, according to the reaction of my grandsons. Aged 7 and 11, they were laughing like crazy!"
1,"Season One was intriguing. Season 2 was implausible on the basic level. JD took a marrow sample from her while she was standing? She sterilized area then touched it with her finger? Not even addressing the aliens, the day to day errors were ridiculous."
1,"Veronica is smart, sassy and a very good private eye!"
1,"Spot on. Absolutely hilarious in s completely realistic, relatable way."
0,"Husband tried to watch it, gave up halfway.He said the issue with this film is there are problems, but no conflicts. The film has no pulse. Thumbs down."
1,"Truly Ken Burns at his best, amazing archival footage and fascinating narrative,  I've watched more than once"
1,We liked it
1,Greet series
1,First show was great

1,Sparks always delivers on a great book and movie.  Just makes you feel good.
0,"Silly, predictable old-timey Western, poorly acted and directed."
1,"Our toddler loves this show. Little does he know, so do his parents!"
1,Great
1,Great show!!
1,Left me wanting more
0,"I guess you could watch this just for the opportunity to laugh at the special effects, which probably were laughable even when the movie was originally made.  But there weren't any more merits to the movie that would enable me to rate it with 3 stars.  Often movie makers realize this before the movie is released and throw in enough gratuitous nudity to compensate, but apparently the creators of this movie thought they had put together an artistic gem that needed nothing more."
1,Great family movie!
1,Blast from the past.
1,"hope to see more of this series, good storyline, likable characters."
1,Delightful comedy!

0,This is an old photo from a few months back. I think it was 383hp to 497trq.
1,"I really liked this movie.  I appreciated the early tension between the characters on the raft that could easily go south to catastrophe, or not.  And the way the tension was finally resolved and how the results reflected the personalities of the characters was meaningful to me."
0,Mediocre acting on everyone's part except Heughan.
1,"One of the best series, I have ever seen.  The different interaction between the key actors and the supporting actors are fascinating and very intriguing....  The script is superbly written."
1,"Meh, nothing super awful, nothing really great"
1,"This is a great show,  great characters , Especially  Longmire . Glad Net flix picked it up"
0,Couldn't finish it.
1,"Love it, watch at least one show every night before bed.  Hope they are back for another season."
1,"Fun. Action-packed. Best movie of 2015. (Until Star Wars, of course.)"
1,Keeps getting better
1,Old
1,"I happened across this movie while browsing videos to watch; I just finished it.  It's a very quiet, powerful, powerful, movie.  We never know how our lives will impact those around us, and that is a great part of what this movie is about.It's a good thing to pay attention to how we interact with those around us. I loved seeing how John May began to move out of the box of his life and learn to live in new ways.  Others have written so beautifully about this sleeper of a lovely film; I am so glad that I watched it and will recommend it to others.<br /><br />It's a slow, thoughtful, and thought-provoking film."
1,"Such fun and the prop work, pratfalls and double takes, priceless!!"
1,Excellent.
1,Excellent
1,"I just can't say enough good about this whole series. I have several generations of family history in this amazing, crazy, politic-ridden town and in LOVE with the music, art and energy of the area. It's magical and this whole series captured it...to a &#34;T.&#34; If you want to know more about the heartbeat of this town, watch all 4 seasons!"
1,Typical Charlie Chan flick. OK light period  entertainment.
1,Fabulous!!
1,Excellent
1,Great seriers
1,Really enjoyed the Pilot and I hope you decide to make this a series...  We would watch it ...
1,"I really enjoyed this first episode.  I hope that Amazon continues with this series, and I hope that it doesn't devolve into something vulgar (like many Amazon series do)."
1,"I decided to download some episodes from Season 1 for a long plane flight. I was blown away by how good this show is. The Acting, writing, set design, etc. This was one of the best things I've seen on TV."
0,Terrible movie
1,"This show is consistently funny every single episode. When my wife and I are watching back through them, we have to laugh because, invariably, one of us says &#34;Oh, this is a funny one,&#34; when we start the episode."
1,"Good show, fun, some interesting  new takes on old &#34;supernatural&#34; ideas - particularly for a show that's on MTV - acting and dialogue can be a bit clunky at times, but all in all, would rate each season so far(1-4) 4 stars"
1,"I was surprised that I enjoyed this film as much as I did. These romantic things are not usually my favorites, but this one I might even watch again."
1,Fun assortment of characters.
1,"Fascinating history, well told.  I will probably watch it again. I learned more than I ever had in school."
1,Liked it<br />Typical JS plot line
1,great series
1,"Watching them all over again, love it!"
1,it is okay
0,he used to be funny
1,Ending up binge watching all five seasons in a week. A non stop section paced sci-fi show. My only annoyance was how often the main characters keep getting themself caught.
1,Great movie
1,Good sci-fi story.
0,Dynasty doesn't hold up. But did it even hold up in the 1980s?
1,Consistently good plot lines. Never slow.
1,"It was good, not great, but good.<br />An enjoyable evening"
1,"Interesting Docu, also very sad."
1,Thanks
1,"Good season, great show."
1,"Very well done, good cinematography, good costumes great acting and a likely more realistic view of what the people were like, the bickering that took place just like today and how this country was really formed. I learned Thomas Jefferson was shy and wrote the entire Declaration of Independence, some editing afterword by others but his concept. He also wanted to abolish slavery in the document, Southern states wouldn't have signed it and we wouldn't have the country we have today. Competing economic interests just like today. Want to see more!"
1,Great movie.
1,"Third season started to slip as Gene Roddenberry had gone on to another project, and the quality of the writing simply was most as good,"

1,"Good, light comedy show."
1,"This is an outstanding, thought-provoking series that both entertains AND informs. My teenage children were as engrossed by each and every episode as I was, and we spent a considerable amount of time talking about the characters, the storyline, and the historical events that the show frequently tied into. Riveting. (We frequently watched Season 1 & 2 episodes back-to-back on Amazon Prime to follow the plot without interruption.) Wish the show had run another 7 seasons."
1,This series concept has me addicted to the show. I can't wait to see what's next. Love the show!!!

1,"Gets Better as it goes along, by the end I really enjoyed it."
1,Good movie !!!!!
1,"Yes, second greatest show ever!"
1,Exceptional acting from Jane Fonda as she portrays a call girl with a difficult past trying to be an actress. The movie centers around her psychological development and redemption from a romance with a detective searching for a psychopath preying on call girls. Donald Sutherland portrays the detective who is a catalyst for her psychological transformation.
1,"Slows down a bit too much in season five. It seems like they are running out of story lines, as episodes are rehashing similar stories from the past few seasons."
1,this  is  number one with my  grandaughter
1,Very good!
1,"great movie,a little long though.my laptop bettery ran out just b4 the end."
1,Inprefer to rate immediately after watching.  Unable to remember later.
1,Love it!
1,Very few actors could pull off a full-length movie with just one person and hardly any dialog.  Robert Redford rocks!  This movie reminded me of why I wasn't interested in off-shore sailing.
1,"Love it, it's awesome to watch a show I watched as a child and see the episodes I miss!"
1,My God children loved the movie. My God son sat to watch the whole movie. Which is hard for him to do.

1,love these type of movies
1,Excellent story lines.
1,If only they put this much effort into the storyline as they do the dinner table and etiquette this TV show wouldn't have gone downhill after season 2.
1,"This is the all time best WWII series, without a doubt. I believe it surpasses recent series The Pacific.  Lots of great scenes, settings, audio. It is almost perfect.  Certainly portrays in depth real life people, emotions, fears, and ability to sustain and survive.  Acting was wonderful, and I think Damian Lewis can do no wrong!"

1,"One of the check-offs on my bucket list is to see every twilight zone episode (sheltered life, I know). With amazon prime, I'm getting it done!<br /><br />The episodes are crystal clear and I love the additional &#34;previews&#34; by Rod serling for the following weeks' episode at the end of the video. This feature is not included in the episodes I see on Netflix. Note to Amazon: include more stuff like this in the future for television shows."
1,Good movie!!!
1,"This is a fun, silly, and genuine feel-good movie. I remember seeing it as a kid and I just watched it with my 10 year old daughter on her birthday. She loved it and laughed at all the goofy 10 year old humor."
1,A fun movie. A few twist in the plot. The movie starts off right from the beginning. No slow parts in the story telling.
0,"Boring, story dragged out, don't know what Eric Roberts was doing in this.  It could have been an interesting story but the writing and acting.... meh!"
1,Still enjoying this show!!
0,"I had really wante to see this movie in the theaters. The trailers looked so promising. But this movie is a mess! Nonsensical, nonlinear and trying. I stopped watching it multiple times because i found my self questioning the dialogue and story."
1,Great movie.
1,Sadistic movie too much blood
1,"I was glad to realize that the episode was my very favorite. I have seen or bought every video I could find, but this is by far the best one. I look forward to viewing the subsiquent episodes to the end. Based on this series, I have started reading &#34;Jane Austen style books&#34;. Enjoyable all."
1,love this movie.
1,Great show!
1,very good movie
1,"It kind of portrays a more truer story of Hercules. Most of the events recorded in &#34;Greek Mythology&#34; are scientifically true by location and person, however the things they have said to have done have been put in metaphors or over glorified. This movie Hercules never says the stories are true of what he's done, and everyone says what is true is he's done good deeds and saved so and so people. I think it is a brilliant aspect on the myth."
1,This series is all in German subtitles and is about the tension between West Germany and East Germany during the Stasi years.  Martin is a young man recruited to be a spy who slips over to the West.  The show is filled with tension and plays like a thriller.  It has twists and turns that are completely unexpected.  The back story involves Martin's single mother and his pregnant girlfriend.  Each episode is worth every sitting!
0,Boring
0,I think it's dumb.
1,A must see
1,"Lovely, heartfelt movie! Olly Alexander is impeccable. The chemistry is palpable"

1,it's ok. a little cheesy.
0,All the bad parts of society are amplified.  No redeeming qualities in this series.
1,Our kids love it!
1,"Great movie! The cast is fabulous, the writing is witty and entertaining. If you have ever been in food service you will appreciate the spot on portrayal of the business. But you can also relate to this movie if you have ever been burnt out, micro-managed, emotionally adrift. By the end of the movie I was cheering for the guy!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. Warning: you will get hungry!"
1,It's ok but is being dragged out like &#34;Lost&#34; was.
1,An all-time favorite. I enjoy Colin Firth's acting and several of the other actors as well. It's lengthy but will always be my preferred version to watch!

1,There isn't much that has to be said about the black noir Twilight Zone. It's totally classic.
1,Gripping and worth watching. Was a good cliff hanger and not too gory.
1,I want to see more! Can't wait!
1,Excellent storylines. I just wish they'd make them without all the excessive profanity. It's just not necessary and distracts from the show.
1,"As I have said in my review of Season 3, this show is AMAZING!!!  So many twist & turns and when you think you have it figured out---well, you should NEVER think you have it figured out put it that way!!!  You will not be disappointed but you do need to start from Season 1, episode 1!!!"
1,Very funny!!
1,"This is not a typical Jackie Chan film, it is the historically accurate story of the birth of modern China and the overthrow of corrupt Imperial dynasty.  At the center is the father of China Sun Yat-sen and the first President of the Republic of China. Jackie Chan portrays Sun's lead General. great warfare scenes and even a love story intertwined. It is a must see film."
1,Loved the movie

0,If you have seen Paradise Lost...you will hate this. I didn't even watch more than a half hour before I was bored stiff. Paradise Lost (documentary-true story) was very well done...and much more gripping.

1,"Emmy award winning series. Not much else to say.  Enjoying, watching it again."
1,It is not add good as Stargate sg-1. But it is good Alii sci fi none the less
1,I'm enjoying this series as I enjoy the era depicted. The characters are well developed and the storyline unfolds to keep you wondering what will become of them as time goes on.
1,It had a few parts that were exciting; especially the end. It doesn't equal the first movie in overall quality.
1,good.
1,"Me and my children are all hard core Dr. Who Fans going back almost 40 years.  This Christmas episode was great, because it was a little inexpected.  We are very late watching it, but it was a fun Sunday afternoon spent with all the kids over."
1,"Weakest of the six seasons, in my opinion.  Plot complexity is maintained, and characters are consistent, but in my view there are a significant number of implausible behaviors.  I can't really discuss details without offering spoilers.  And it is still mighty good drama."
1,"Fast with a lot of twist, Don't miss it. Good for a 'popcorn movie night'. Not a chick flick."
1,Can't wait to see the full season in November.
1,Not the same as the other transformer movies.
1,"Funny, but raw with language and sexual situations that would not be appropriate for younger kids."
1,"This is a very good series. well worth watching,"
1,"Cute movie.  Attractive actors.  Interesting plot and very good acting.  Overall, I enjoyed watching it and could watch it again."
1,Entertaining .
1,Weird twist on Beauty and the Beast.  But it was a good little love story.
1,"It was a decent film, but the filmmakers could have given a better look at the villian."
1,Good to see it after many years ... still holds up as a good road action movie.
1,"So is there any way for me to turn in my US citizenship for Canadian. I do not use drugs. The closest is taking Adderall for ADHD. And really I do not want to. But so much that was said, especially what was not drug related is what frustrates me and shames me about being American. The arrogance of the US stampeding across other countries, ignoring their sovereignty. The US just takes and does whatever it wants. The arrogance of the US. The unwillingness to look at other examples and possibilities like they were saying about not looking to Europe. The hypocrisy. I want to move to Canada and trade on my US citizenship for Canadian.<br />I also do think drugs should be legal. I don't want to use them, never cared for them. But between the horrors of the drug war and the horror of personal violations. The idea that I can have a substance in my home and am not harming another person but the police can barge into my home uninvited is terrifying. Funny thing is this attitude is even unIslamic. People talk of Islam being oppressive and yet the laws of the US l are more so. Mind you many Muslim countries do not follow the laws of Islam correctly. But Islam is clear that what you do in private in your home is between you and God. There is even a story of a Muslim leader who heard singing and entered a man's home catch g him drinking alcohol. But the man then pointed out that while this leader had caught him doing on wrong thing the leader had done three by entering his home from the back not the front, entering without grating and entering without permission.<br />Alcohol is more dangerous. Smoking is more dangerous. The war on drugs is more dangerous than drugs. The entire thing is moronic and needs to be changed"
1,Always a funny watch.
1,scary
1,My kids love this show (4 & 6)
1,"Very raunchy.. But, I loved it.."
1,Stories have great depth

1,Classic and entertaining.
1,We love this series!
1,"Although, I've never read the original books by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  I suspect that this is a modernized version.  In this movie, which takes place in modern times.  The Greystokes own a large corporation that specializes in energy production. Mother & Father Greystoke are in Africa with their son trying to find an, as of yet, untapped source of energy.  Their helicopter crashes into the side of a remote ravine.  The only survivor is Tarzan who is found and cared for by a gorilla.  Time passes and Tarzan eventually becomes the ruler of the gorillas.  Greystoke Industries continues to search for the energy source and comes back into contact with Tarzan.<br /><br />I don't think the movie is bad.  The animation is ok.  The plot is fairly straight forward.  The problem is the Disney version of Tarzan is so good and entrenched in my memory that this one just can't compare on any level.  You watch and think, &#34;Hmm, OK, that's done.&#34;, when it's over."
1,Great story and acting!
1,Wish it would have not ended! Loved how the entire season was based on one issue.
1,Excellent movie. Well analyzed refute to atheists and agnostics.
1,This was a great series with a lot of interesting twists.  Too bad it was canceled.
1,still watching
1,Add it to your pixar collection. No princesses and teaches the value of family/friends.
1,My wife and I both enjoy this series.
1,"Riveting.  Beautifully shot and great attention to period detail.  The show is set in 1962, and the world is as it is if the Axis had won the war, the architecture, transport, state flags etc.  America has been divided.  The West coast under Japanese rule, the East under German rule.  Don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it but watch out for the 'snow' scene.  Cannot wait for the full series to hit Prime."
1,I want to have a Lost Thing!  It works on so many levels.

1,"Hilarious, crass humor. One of those &#34;so dumb it's funny&#34; movies. Very few movies make me laugh out loud, this one succeeded.  Loved it!"
1,Kids (9 and 6) both love this and I like the effort to mix teaching (math in the episode I saw) with the story line.
1,This proves the brilliance of Ms. Christie as a mystery writer and David Suchet with his masterful interpretation of her lead character. Excellent!
1,We are big fans!
1,"This is a play made into a movie. I do not know if it was actually written as a play. It takes place in one room with a limited number of minor actors and the total is primarily looks and physical actions put together with the constant questions and arguments of the script. Quite well done, except as in so many movies and books, the ending leaves without a goodbye. There was no definitive ending and what I was left with was just a typically bad ending. Hence only 4 stars."
1,Too slow moving but good story.
1,"Simply amazing. Not just a fantastic and new story. But, the work put into bringing it all together - the music, the acting, the backgrounds that make you rewind - all of it are easily worth 5 stars"
1,"Awesome show, great location stories, family morals. A forgetful time when everyday folks lived life and still know what family is about and to keep it going. Including family talk and prayer awesome"
1,classic animated series if you're a batman fan.

1,"good story line, casting and acting. each episode is like watching a good movie."
1,"We enjoyed this movie. However, we thought the first one was better. It did leave off at a great point leaving you ready for the next movie in the series."
1,Never saw &#34;Blue Velvet&#34; when it came out.  Out of curiosity I watch it  and found it somewhat dated.  Remarkable amount of nudity and violence for that era. It's a bit slow in parts.  The late Dennis Hooper is as strange as ever.  On second thought I'd give it 2-1/2 stars.
1,"Excellent, good actors and convincing photography"
0,"The mountain chase scene is worth a watch the rest is just not enjoyable. The Turtle's personalities are interesting but Shredder is campy and stupid weird. Splinter is bizarre to watch. As a fan from the early 90's Ninja Turtles I was not impressed. Raph however was done pretty well, I liked when he called Vernon a &#34;human nerd&#34;."
1,"Amazing show!  Great character development.  Elliot breaks my heart.  Had to have one of my tec geek friends watch it with me (he likes it too) to translate and check the tec validity which, according to him, is spot on.  Season 2?"
1,Intense
1,"I love this show, they tell good stories"
1,Amazing. Hilarious. Witty and Smart. The show you should be watching. The only downside is that when I finished I missed Rob and Sharon so much---Upside to that: they are working on Season 2!<br /><br />How to live a happy life in 5 words: Watch Amazon's Catastrophe Right Now.
1,Continuation of the series just get more exciting and interesting.Thank God all the actors remain. Please people watch it its some series you wont regret and during the watch you can never get bored.i'll highly recommend.
1,the actors are worth watching but if you've been around for awhile this movie brings nothing new.
1,Great show.  Can't wait for the next season to come out.
1,This show is addicting!
1,Love the story lines.
1,Very well done.

1,"Good, but not great. Maybe they should have released the whole season at once so it is easier to make a rating based on the character development of more than one episode."
0,"Cute, clever dialog, totally phoney, cartoony.  Don't care about them or their problems, which will be superficial and shallow, probably."
1,Interesting
1,"All good to great stuff, as expected!"
1,Great old movie. Boyer and Lamar are fantastic.
1,"Almost completely family friendly.  People trying to be good, is always good to see."
1,Excellent start to a series!
1,Excellent
1,Refreshing and among general population as prequel more suspenseful. Looks like it will be a huge hit for AMC.
1,"Basically if you like Seinfeld, Community, Arrested Development, Community and The Office, this comedy is for you."
1,Classic Kubrick.  25 minutes of film before the first line of dialogue is spoken!
1,Great movie
1,Just about the best WWII drama I've yet seen - surpasses even &#34;Private Ryan/&#34;
1,Quite entertaining. Better than I thought it would be.
1,Well done.
1,Very different plot line.  I enjoyed it!
1,Loved it when it was on TV so much that I'm watching it from the beginning.
0,superficial
1,entertaining
1,Awesome as all previous seasons.  I still miss Will tho :o (
1,Compelling portrayal of a complicated relationship between two gifted but tortured souls. Roth and Rhys are outstanding as Vincent and Theo Van Gogh.
1,I really enjoyed watching this video on my flight to Vegas a movie with a twist
1,I really want to watch season 6 and 7
1,"If you love the Army-Navy football game and respect these student athletes, you will respect them even more after watching this.  More of a documentary, but an awesome story."
1,Beautiful documentary about adult twins confronting the tragedy and twists of their childhood with strength and realism.
1,Typical Scooby-Doo.<br /><br />My kids are Scooby-Doo fans and well so is Dad!
1,Kids can't stop watching.
1,I do hope to see a season 2
1,Good one.
1,Excellent
0,This story was not well developed - sadly. I would not waste my time.
1,"My entire family, from 10 years old to myself at 45, absolutely LOVE this show. It is one of a series of fantastic shows put out by the SYFY network. We are starting it for the second time, due to the duration of time between its initial release and the release of the last season which just came out. It is exciting, interesting, intriguing, and sometimes even a bit cheeky. However it has something for everyone, and I would encourage everyone to try it out. After 5 episodes, you will be hooked!"
1,it's a good movie.
1,perfect show~
1,Excellent!  Never know what to expect for sure.  Great series!  Can't wait to see what happens next.  :-)
0,It is certainly one of the worst movies I've watched this year. I only recommend for those who like violence and no story.
1,Very entertaining.
1,Could not watch/stream the final 2 seasons with my Prime account.  It would be $75 extra.  Would be nice to know before I started the series.
1,kids love it.
1,"I love this movie! I had seen it once as a kid and It was a very memorable movie. I'm now married and own 3 dogs, one being an American Bulldog, my wife had never seen this movie so I decided to revisit this beautiful classic. We both laughed and felt the emotions though out the whole clip, such a nice movie. I definitely recommend this movie especially because it is a family & animal loving oriented movie!"
1,It's great.
1,"Best American drama I've watched in years.  Aaron Sorkin creates another wonderful, thought provoking experience!  Sorkin created West Wing which is a fave of ours too."
1,"Classic , awesome movie"
1,I know this man. Jim Hopper.
1,"Pretty good, not the best but not a bad flick."
1,Superb!
1,"I had wanted to see this since it came out and finally got to it.  Binge watched all of the seasons and was completely enthralled.  No wonder that it won so many awards! Great writing, acting and I'd go so far as to say, it was one of the best series I have ever seen.  Character driven, with richness beyond description.  By the end, I was sobbing and had run through every emotion available.  I definitely recommend this series! Like a great book, you will miss these characters, long after it's over."
1,I really enjoyed this movie.
1,Love this show! Very witty!! Look forward to another season.
1,"I like watching this show, it's interesting and the characters are great."
1,The best
0,if anyone finds this an &#34;uplifting film&#34; I think its time to ring the Suicide Hotline !!! This was a combination of Ole Yella meets Betty Ford !  This is one more attempt from Hollywood to make us think that odd balls of society are the ruling factor.  A woman who has been widowed and retired for 20 years and drinks her lunch- decides to start smoking pot out of boredom and hasn't been out at night in 2 decades  is not something we need to aspire to !!!! Its a sad case of one wasting a life and not something that deserves a movie.  As far as the Director of this depression feast - are they truly getting that lazy that they no longer attempt a sound track or any form of background setting and the dinner scene was almost laughable !! ?? This is so dull and quite it is like watch a bad reality show ........ so the message is .....once your husband dies you hunker in the house with a case a wine?? NICE MESSAGE !  I would call this a case of &#34; A Conscious Uncoupling Of Talent&#34; !!!!
1,"When I compare this show to something similar done on US television, this UK production tells the story without all the extra drama and gimmicks found in U.S. Shows. The characters are very well defined, and you really cared about them. It was very realistic, something that could really happen. It really captured how people react under these conditions."
1,Not as good as 1st season.
1,"Didn't think they could keep it fresh, but they did!"
1,"Great show, just picked it back up and looking forward to each episode!"
1,Love Love Loved it!
1,"For the first time in my 69 years, I'm reading &#34;Last of the Mohicans.&#34; Remembering there was a film, we decided to watch it, so as to have a visual while reading.<br />The photography is great. The casting and acting were great. But, I was particularly struck by the dissimilarities between the book and the film. Here is what they have in common:<br />Hawkeye and his two confederates; the Colonel and his daughters; the major, and the antagonist, Magua, were in both.<br />The plot of the movie was somewhat similar to that of the book, but enough different as to create wonder if they were intended to represent the same work. The beginning, middle and end of the movie were all different from the book.<br />Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but J. F. Cooper would not recognize it as his."
1,Incredibly powerful movie!
1,Love it!!
1,Excellent series kept us interested and we ended up binge watching!! Ready for season 3
0,Couldn't even stay interested long enough to get through more than about 15 minutes.
1,Kept me. Interested
1,Good kids movie!
1,It was the perfect movie for what I needed it for: a cry fest. Was it actually a great movie? It was alright. But it gave me the feels I was looking for! Haha
1,Excellent! Never a dull moment. Intelligent banter.
0,Didn't like
1,New king is to soft on relatives and everybody else is super paranoid so there is no place for peace. (Spoiler alert) The crazy woman in the end gets what she wants. This show is not for for men.
0,A pointless poorly-made carbon copy of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS that brings nothing new to the table...except incessantly obnoxious characters and dreadful CGI.  The scariest thing you'll see here is Lance Henriksen's saggy butt in extreme close-up.
1,Excellent!
1,LOVE IT.  Wish there wasn't only one more season:(
1,My husband and I are really enjoying this fun series.
1,Love it
1,Fun stuff.  Suspend reality and get into a story book way of thinking.
1,"It may be only about 8 minutes long, but it's so good! Cute, funny, great song and all the characters you love from Frozen."
1,I really enjoy this series.
1,Love it
1,Great!
1,This season has lived up to my best expectations
1,my son love big truck so this is one of his favorite shows to watch  sadly there is only one episode and he watches it over and over
1,Loveeeeee
1,It was a great show that constantly had you on the edge of your seat. The suspense was great and I loved all the twists and turns. Such a simple title for a complex show!
1,Very entertaining!
1,Love this show!!!
0,couldn't watch but a few minutes
1,I liked it.
1,Always a delight to watch. Kicking butt never gets old!
1,This movie is pretty good . It could have been better ending.
1,Very funny
1,I like watching  the Aussie be a detective.
1,My 2 year old is in love with this. Great cartoon.
1,"I really LOVED this movie!  The whole thing surprised me, as I had never heard of it before and knew nothing about it.  Love it!"
1,I thought this fall pilot was awesome!  I really liked this show.
1,We love it!
1,"A very, very sweet movie.  But you will need tissues handy at the end!"
1,Very good
0,Not
1,Best series or even movie ever made about WWII. Nothing comes close to the real picture this paints of this part of history. Even saving Private Ryan can't hold a candle to this series.
1,Decent mystery
1,My new favorite movie
1,Love this show.
1,It's not a bad show but I caught myself thinking get on with it. Friend s said it gets better. I fell asleep.
1,Was good
1,The kiddos love it.
1,"I loved this when it first came out, but my husband and I just watched it last night and found it almost unbearably slow in places. CGI graphics had just come out when this was made. The movie's climax is nothing but the characters staring at the special effects for ten minutes. This is not the movie's fault, but more a symptom of changing times.<br /><br />Life in general moves much faster today. The Internet makes most human knowledge available at the click of a button now, whereas back then one had to travel to the library and look in the card catalog and find a reference book. We microwave our TV dinners now in five minutes, instead of putting them in the oven for 45 minutes.<br /><br />That said, I still enjoyed seeing Leonard Nimoy alive and well. Rest in peace, Leonard.<br /><br />My husband Googled the actress who played this bald character and were shocked to discover she is dead, too. She died in the late 1990s in her early 50s. really sad. And it hit home because we're in our early 50s now.<br /><br />We also looked up the captain-turned commander who played her love interest and were amused to find out he played a minor part in Falling Skies. We plan on checking out those two episodes again soon, this time knowing where we've seen him before.<br /><br />And of course, there's William Shatner, always fun to see as Captain Kirk. I met him last summer at PACCON. It was one of my biggest fangirl moments ever. :)<br /><br />Love the original Star Trek TV series, which is never this boring. They didn't need special effects to make it exciting, either. Instead, the original series had excellent dialogue and pacing.<br /><br />Bottom line: This film relies too heavily on CGI graphics, which are no longer interesting in and of themselves."
1,"The first couple of episodes weren't great, but as the series progresses the story gets stronger."
0,Teen angst movie...boring and laughable. Yawn...so whatever.
1,This was a great &#34;feel good&#34; movie
1,"I wasn't a fan of Grimm when is started a few years ago,  but I was looking for something to watch on Amazon and decided to give it another try.  It's quite good.  Later seasons are better,  but this is a very watchable show."
1,Love the show and the characters.
1,Excellent preview of the second season
1,Alright. Had funny moments just wasnt a fan of the good guy turned bad turned good again.
1,My two-year-old twins love this! Both my son and daughter. It is a very high-quality show and really cute! I sure wish they had had this show when I was little!
1,Excellent.  Acting A++.
1,"Having been a fan of Miyazaki's work for the past 20 years, I knew that I would appreciate a look inside the doors of studio ghibli. What I was not expecting was to be awestruck by the immense talent of the man and to feel like he was looking through the screen and into my soul. The gifts he has given human civilization should not be undervalued. He has held something precious to show the children of the world, as long as there is one."
1,Great series. Shows everyone can have good and bad in them and its all about your choices and actions
1,"This is the best series that has been made in a long time. The acting is wonderful, I can't wait for the 4th season to be made and released. Tatiana should win an award for her performances, since she plays multiply characters and it is amazing to watch."
0,Just Bad
1,Enjoyed this
1,One of the best movies I've seen
1,daughter loves this movie
1,Great action show
1,Our whole family loves this show!
1,An old fav!
1,Enjoyed the story line and the cast. It was nice to watch an adult show without any f... words.
1,"Love this show, lot's of twists and turns. Totally addictive"
1,Can't wait for season 4 to come to prime
1,love it
0,"What a disappointment. I normally love Cameron Crowe but this seriously made me question his writing ability as of late. Emma Stone was a terrible choice for her role. It lacked in the plot, I never felt any connection with any of the characters. I want my $5 back for the 90 minutes I wasted watching this disaster of a film."
1,Worth watching.
1,Absolutely loved these episodes.  The fact the they involve fairly current events makes it so more relatable.
1,Great show!
1,This was an ok film.
1,This is PBS at its finest.
0,"This is NOT the Lord of the Rings, this is a Peter Jackson story and movie.<br /><br />I grew up on the Lord of the Rings.  I've read it so often that I practically have it memorized.  Jackson's &#34;adaptation&#34; of the story in all three of these movies strips the magic and the majesty from the story to fit a commercial plot line.<br /><br />So very much that was vital to the emotional impact of Tolkien's vision was removed and replaced by pablum.  Too much that was never in the books was added, and all of Jackson's additions detract from the tale.<br /><br />Every time I see even a short snippet of Jackson's movies, I feel angry.<br /><br />The CGI is good, so two stars - but only to the programmers.  This is a sad maladaptation of an epic tale and Jackson has no shame."
1,"I thought it was very imformative, I enjoyed being entertained and learning at the same time."
0,It was an ok movie.
1,Great show! Kept me entertained.
1,Great show - their chemistry is fantastic.
0,We didn't even watch it all the way through. Turned it off after 30 minutes.<br />Love both actresses but they were just too winey in this movie.
1,Hooked.
0,Lame movie
1,My 11 year old daughter really liked this show (she hasn't read the books) and wants to see more. I also enjoyed it. Very cute show.
1,funny and entertaining
1,Very uplifting and entertaining. We can all learn to be positive and do the right thing from Ramon
1,So well done! I wish the real news was like this.
1,"I didn't like the plot of this movie very slow sleepy not worth watching and I was hoping Segal was going to berunning in this pic, but he just cameod at begining and end, total Junk"
0,Overrated. boring story.
0,well not my style.
1,Great show
1,great
0,Total waste of time
1,A taste of Africa during British rule.
1,Best show ever.so glad it finally made it to prime!!!!
1,"Kurland is one of the finest Tai Chi instructors I can think of.  A very holistic approach to the old art, and very calming."
1,Interesting concept. Great cast.
1,A wonderfully told story about love in senior years. It brought tears to my eyes. Plus these actors are still so fabulous in their art!
1,Addicted
1,Fantastic wordsmith's and great characters
1,Enterprise would still destroy the Death Star.
1,I've enjoyed every episode.  Easy to follow.  Not too time consuming.
1,very good
1,Great show
1,First episode didn't grab me but will try #2
1,Just when you think that you have everything figured out....you don't .  Interesting plot with the players displaying their true character.
1,"Great movie,  very very interesting that you can't stop watching it"
0,slow is the operative word.  Too slow for me.
1,I like the way the &#34;heroes&#34; are challenged every episode.
1,very tense and full of surprises!
1,Compelling story
1,The Entourage series should have ended with this season.
1,Lots of twists and love how it integrates old England and the monster stories together
0,"Very disappointing. No plot, no character development and ends abruptly."
1,Great movie !!
1,"My son love's &#34;Bob Bob&#34;, as he puts it."
1,It's funny because it's so real...
1,Watered down version of &#34;you're the worst&#34; (a series by FX) but still kind of cute and funny. Watchable. But not exactly awesome to be honest.
1,Castle is by far one of my favorite tv series! #caskette's story is beautifully written to include perfect romance/drama/action and suspense. Beckett is my type of role model woman.
1,"My whole family loves this show although I may love it a little more.  Hope to see many more seasons, mel-bot kills me."
1,Better movie than I thought it would be.  Thought they showed all the funny parts in the trailer but it was funny and heart warming.  Kids really liked it too.
0,So stupid I had to watch the entire series. Typical Will Ferrell garbage
1,Love it
1,Awesome
1,Great series
1,Great show. Love it
1,Very interesting subject matter.
1,Love this show
1,R.I.P Wes craven thanks for the memories thanks for the nightmares
1,"Rather a low-key character, but, as always, likeable.<br />Worricker manages to charm his way through life, helping people and being kind -<br />very unlike what you might expect from a spy.<br />But practical and rather sensible when it comes to reality.<br />We really enjoyed the wit and subtle humor."
1,I like the show
1,This is a great comedy that's probably overlooked. If you're looking for a quirky comedy relax and watch this movie.
1,Six feet under is a awesome show!
1,One of the best shows ever.
1,Love the players
1,Best show I have seen since Breaking Bad!  This must not be missed in my opinion.  Writing is excellent.
1,OK AT BEST
1,Absolutely Reveting.
1,Liked this movie If I Stay. Very touching to the heart. Some where sometime it could happened in your life with love one's closest to U.  Satisfied Amazon customer
1,"Great show, can't wait to see more.  Not into comedies but love this program."
1,Good movie for kids and adults. Lots<br />Of funny parts and great characters
1,Loved the excitement can't wait for season 3 to be  free with  Prime .
1,No bad
1,I have enjoyed this series and I'm starting season two.
1,Really good.
1,My young grandson loves this one too.
1,This is our 5th season and it has stayed fast paced and very interesting!
1,"Very, very good series.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Guardian Season 1 and highly recommend it"
0,"OK, here's the thing: that Gosling guy? Doesn't say anything in this movie.  I don't buy this guy's brooding stiffness you see what I'm sayin'? There's no human element to his character so you wonder how he has friends or love interests or anything.  He's trying so hard to seem like a tough guy, but he comes off as mild-to moderately autistic, not sociopathic.  Gosling goes for TOO mysterious to the point that it doesn't even make sense. And the director made this movie TOO stylized.  I don't buy this movie's stylized pop violence thing that it's trying to do.  Leave that stuff to Quentin Tarantino.  Trying way too hard.  Real bad movie."
1,Everything in this show executes flawlessly.
1,Good job
1,Ton of potential in this show.
1,Great cast...can't wait for season 3
1,I really liked this first episode and cannot wait for the series to start. Ron rocks! Interesting character he plays with a great plot. Will binge the HiZell out of this when available.
1,Really liked the story and the characters.
1,i really enjoyed this movie
1,Exciting loved it
1,A very witty and amusing adult series.
0,"If I could give this zero stars, I would."
0,This movie is not worth watching.
1,Excellent movie and I was glad to beable to watch it courtesy of Amazon!
1,One of my favorite movies.
1,My daughter absolutely loves this show. Too much sometimes. I hope they have another season soon. Here is her master piece.
1,Hytf
1,Awesomeness
1,Amy Poehler is Michael Scott in drag. She&#34;s a wonder actress to watch.
1,so so at best not as good as the 1st
1,Very informative. I am planning a trip there and this helped greatly.
1,"Great movie, really liked how it was done"
1,Pretty good! Love Dustin Hoffman.
1,"great show , my girls love it !"
1,"Independent film with a wonderful very interesting and diverse cast. I loved Bella and all the characters that loved her, fought for her and celebrated her lives in their own ways!"
1,"I  didn't think Season 2 could be as good as the first season, but it is!"
1,Very entertaining
1,Very funny and suspenseful
1,A masterpiece of animated Art!
1,love this show! great acting.  so much happens in an episode you just can't stop watching
1,"That was so funny, so funny, it was nice to see Shaquille, laugh at the jokes about him, and his baby's mothers! I will watch it again, with my friends and family. I had a great time watching this!"
0,"Considering the sterling cast, I was expecting a good storyline.  It was poorly directed and scripted in my opinion.  I suspect<br />the reason that it was made at all was because of the connections to Marion Cottilard and her partner, the director.  They<br />must have called in a few favors!"
1,This movie made me want to learn more about him.
1,I love this Movie its Better than the first Gremlins.
1,This strays more into fantasy than other seasons but also wraps up the story well.  Not my favorite season but an interesting way to end the series.
1,"Super cute, slowly paced."
0,Bad acting and poorly cast. Very disappointing!
1,My four year old really liked it!  He was bummed there weren't additional episodes to watch.
1,Was good
1,Funny
1,funny
1,Such an amazing story. Sometimes s*** looked this can happen.
1,"Still love the storyline and the diverse characters--Andie MacDowell shines, of course, as Olivia--I hope the scriptwriters allow her and Jack to finally get together without so many obstacles and distractions."
1,Great movie
1,Cannot put into words how much I would suggest watching this show! It is great for anyone who has ever felt... awkward.
0,Not really a movie.waste of money.
1,Great program
1,Never disappointed with a Stephen King ANYTHING!
1,"Smart, hilarious, family friendly.  Shaun the Sheep is that rare combination that parents and kids will both love to watch together."
1,Great movie
1,"Definitely one of the better modern, HD kids' shows. I hate the theme song, as I generally find Randy Newman to be one of the most annoying musicians of all time, but other than that, it's a really solid show and my daughter loves it."
1,Good movie
1,Hillarious!!!!
1,"Hooked me literally from the opening credits! Love the premise, characters, set, costumes and adore the actors. Watched the season in two days. You got me, DA!!!!"
1,one of the best hitchcock
1,Incredible film about the courage & bravery of the American soldier.
1,Outstanding movie
1,Very good.
1,Have so enjoyed each episode of Suits!  Will look forward to watching each and everyone!
0,Couldn't get into it all. To many Subtitle's
1,"Good film, interesting twists and thought provoking questions about humanity. Alex Garland has a masterful control of the camera and the pace of the film is brisk with segmentation similar to 2001. Some predictable storytelling and rehashed sci-fi tropes but overall a worthy contender in the AI vs. Man genre."
1,Awesome movie!  Brings back memories of camp and friends made...how our lives didn't quite turn out the way we had thought they would.  It's a wonderful &#34;feel-good&#34; movie.  The location is out of this world beautiful!
1,Smart writing and a great cast.  This show is way more enjoyable than watching the real goofballs that are in politics these days.
1,It's bawdy and profane but it's a hoot!
1,Love the show!  Special effects are amazing!
1,Good movie with a twist. Recommended
1,Good flick
1,Love<br />this show.
1,We watched it as a family and my 11 and 8 yr old daughters loved it'
1,"A little rough around the edges and sometimes slow moving, but it is worth watching if you're into the old wild, wild west."
1,Awesome show
1,"Crazy for this show, the actors, and the writing!  This has become a go-to binge ,with popcorn! A strong beautiful female lead and action packed scripts keep me coming back."
1,"I really enjoyed the 1st and 2nd seasons but I am quickly losing interest in the third. Without giving anything away, the plot just seems completely disconnected from the original story."
1,"Fantastic movie.  But, it only hints at the affects of PTSD on our servicemen and women, as well as the physical changes they've had to endure from losing limbs."
1,Well done.
0,I would not call this a new West Wing as the characters lack likability and depth.  I'll watch a few more episodes but so far I am not impressed.
1,"Sci-fi traditionally takes a few liberties with science. This movie took science, bent it over the hood of a 79 Trans-Am and ***** it while listening to the sweet sounds of Foghat. 3 stars for good special effects, and decent acting. That's all."
1,Great show
1,I loved Sneaky Pete! It would be great to see more of him and the rest of the family!
1,Although I fell asleep on the end. Lol
1,great
1,Loved the story...we can all identify in some way with this young lady. Our lives have all had a time where we felt we needed to get away and find our own truth. My only complaint is the audio is terrible. Most of the time when the main character is reciting something or reliving a life event you cannot hear what is being said. Then when she is in town or talking with another person the sound comes up and you have to turn it down. I had to have the remote in hand through the whole movie. It was very frustrating. I probably missed 25% or more of the dialog because of the erratic audio.
1,Good
1,My 3rd old grandson loves it.
1,One of my all time favorites to relax.
1,"Sweet story, funny and great for the whole family."
1,I've heard about this show for years! Now I see what all the hype is about. Excellent series.
1,"We love this, very entertaining if you enjoy gangster, you will love this."
1,"I loved this show when I was a kid. It's nice to find that it is available on amazon. These are in black and white but still have better content then most of what is on tv now. Five stars you bet, it's great"
1,Great
1,One of my favorites.
0,No comment
1,Not bad I enjoyed it.
1,Best series I've seen in a few years.
1,"Watching from the beginning with my brother who never saw TWD.  It is absolutely as<br />great the second time around.  Catch a lot of things you missed the first time.  I am<br />an addict and not ashamed to admit it, ;  [<br />Just Bite Me!"
1,loved it
1,"Tender, moving, funny, beautifully filmed and well-written.  Yes, a coming of age story in many ways - but much more than that.  How do we choose in painful situations? What draws us to life? How do we cope with extreme loss. And the power of music.......I have watched this twice and will likely do so again at some point."
1,A beautyful message...
1,Interesting!
1,The improbability and predictable plot get in the way.
1,Very good documentary that makes you think about how free we really are to determine the course of our lives.
1,Super funny at times. Pure entertainment.
1,This was an interesting movie.  Compelling plot.
1,"This is a really excellent new series with a totally different premise from most other shows.  Love the setting in UK with an American protagonist.  Love the relationship and humor used in the writing.  Can't wait for the 2nd season along with Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle.  Amazon:  Keep up the great work at presenting quality programming.  Thank you, thank you, thank you."
1,"For a season 1 show, very well done and enjoyable. :-)"
1,Fast paced; great dialogue; and great actors.
1,My girls (7 and 5 1/2) love this...very cute!  I hope there will be more episodes!!  We have been loving the kids Amazon productions.
1,watched this years ago and am now watching since my hubby never saw it -  I think I like it more now!  Excellent writing and acting.
1,Great movie: a definite display of the American spirit.....
1,Excellent!  Even better than I remember.
1,Enough to pique my attention but not the most intriguing premise.
1,Love it
1,Loved it! But these are my type of movies!
1,Lots of fun!
1,"Exciting and beautifully acted. Andy Garcia continues to be the best of the deadpan-face-when-threatened school, and it is nice to see some of the old-timers like Dreyfus in harness again. The plot is familiar, but the director has whipped it into a new shape."
1,"Very cute. My toddler loved it, my 7 and 8 year olds tolerated it."
1,"Excellent show! Full of twists n turns. Great cast, accomplished screen writers!"
1,It's great to here and see the heroic deeds of those brave men who served during World War II.
1,"I love all of the Donna Leon books, and was so thrilled to run across the German movies and I love them so much."
1,Great escape movie with no redeeming value..
0,boring
1,"I am a big nerd! So i really liked this movie.Now,there are supposed to be books that came out first,but i never read them.However,i did read a book titled &#34;Arena&#34; that i loved! And the movie reminded me a bit about it. I watched with my daughter(19) and husband, niw he had &#34;smart&#34; comments through out the movie so needless to say it might not be a movie for men.<br />:)  All that aside my daughter and I enjoyed it and wait anxiously to see the second one."
1,nice movie!
1,Great movie
1,up to season 4......man this show is good.....love my fire tv stick
1,Loved the movie.
1,"I feel this was a very good movie, a peaceful, yet a lonely thought provoking romance.  I enjoyed it."
1,Awesome show!!
1,Best show! I love it!
1,Fun story. So-so acting.
1,If you loved Seinfeld then you will love this more &#34;adult&#34; type show from one of the co-creators of Seinfeld.
1,Such cute stories. My twins love the characters.
1,"Need a laugh? Sit back and let Kenny Powers do all the work. Funny, outrageous, and guaranteed to get you rolling."
1,I bought this for my five year old as a tune-up video.  It is way too baby like.  I'm sure a two year old would like it okay if it can hold their attention.
1,"absolutely, positively, amazingly one of the greatest movies ever made.  It is topical even today."
1,This is one of the best shows I've ever had the privilege to watch.  My only complaint is that watching these back to back has been burning up my work day :).
1,great show
1,best series ever.
1,GREAT Show
0,Terrible. Not funny at all.
1,great
1,Kept my interest from the beginning.
1,Great
1,"I absolutely loved it and stayed up most of last night watching it, I will say this I did not buy it but downloaded free on ITunes. Well worth the time and great plot, story line and character developments!"
1,Hilarious!! Wonderful dialogue and characters.  I had to watch all six episodes in one sitting and can't wait for the next season.
1,"A good movie, well written and fabulous actors."
1,Such a wonderful show.my two girls 7 and 3 loved it.
1,Strange movie
1,My son loves this movie!
0,Crap!
1,in my top 10
1,Classics... nothing like it.
1,"Suspenseful: You'll find yourself rooting for the Russians even though you're a patriot. The series also has some historical significance. The communist have always been engaged activist groups, they still are."
1,Unpredictable love
1,Excellent
1,Awesome
1,"The biggest reason to watch this show is the lead actress, Tatiana Maslany. She portrays several different characters and somehow actually makes them all different, while exhibiting the similarities one might expect from clones. The plot sometimes feels stretched or slung together, but the acting is exemplary and the suspenseful plot twists are legion. Highly recommended!"
1,Kids really enjoy this show.
0,"I know it's supposed to be scary and suspenseful, but the lighting was terrible - it was so dark I couldn't tell what was going on, so I was never remotely scared...more like confused. And honestly, the lighting didn't make any sense! You are sitting in a dark room and hear a creepy noise...what do you do? 99% of the population is going to turn on the darn light to see what made the noise. These people, however, just keep walking around in the dark house, trying to figure it out. Silly."
1,This original 1975 version has its own unique way of telling this saga. Maybe not as technically savvy  as the new version (2015) both are mesmerizing and stay true to the novels of Winston a Graham. A absolute must for you video library.
1,Excellent series!!!!
1,I like the Gymbox. Their workouts are familiar to me. I've been checking out the videos and some of the moves were similar to studio classes I took before. I recommend these videos!
1,Great plot.. a tease to the end...
1,A good movie with a great twist at the end !
0,"not what I expected, wanted a flick not a commercial."
0,I was bored after 30 minutes of trying to stick with it. Poliakoff has many unique films that I do not care for.
1,REAL AND UPLIFTING
1,Jack Bauer is the best
1,Ok
1,Fun!
1,Great movie
1,Topical story lines make it relevant and six seasons
1,Better movie than I expected it to be.
1,Duvall is great. Good music. Poignant.
1,"Typical &#34;Speghetti Western&#34; Quite good, although extremly slow-moving, extremly long and extremly dated in the technique."
1,A very good story! I thought it was imaginative and original.
1,My grand children love this series and look forward to more.
1,Hoping for more seasons.  Season 8 leaves Larry in Paris at the end...while a fitting cap to the season still leaves you wanting more.
1,The entire family loves it
1,This was eat pray love without the intense drama! It was good and now I think I need to buy it
1,It was all over the place. It took forever to finally figure out what was actually happening and what the movie was about. Only decent because it had decent actors.
1,It was heart wrenching but very well done! My condolences to the families of the victims
1,"Very enjoyable. A little history, a little romance,a little predictable."
1,Classic for a reason
1,Seen it many times and still find things funny each time!
1,"Great ,intelligent, funny dram-com. Really enjoyed it!"
1,Great movie. Guaranteed to make you cry so don't forget the tissues and enjoy the ride.
1,This is a fun family movie with no violence or profanity. My younger kids loved it and my older kids thought it was fun.
1,Strangely good
1,"Great cases, back story, characters, acting, and episodes overall. It pisses me off that her stupid husband has no accountability for his cheating ways, though, and Alicia doesn't have as much backbone as she should. That's why it got 4 stars instead of 5."
1,Excellent
1,Still don't understand why this was only a one-season show.
1,So so
1,its very good
1,"Really good, but you have to read the subtitles!"
1,Insight into a world knew nothing about... horse racing.  Interesting mix of characters and great acting.  Really entertaining.  When are we getting the next season please?
1,awesome movie for the whole family
1,Love this show!
1,Great show
1,Love the show.  On the last 2 episodes of this season.
1,Rewriting could have been alot better but was an original story in my opinion. Not bad for an indy sifi.
1,Love love love it
1,"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,I miss her husband this year.
1,"A few laughs... I liked the other Tyler Perry movies better, but still funny. I will always be a Madea fan."
1,This is an extremely good movie with some outstanding actors and dialogue. I recommend it highly.
1,this was HBO i didn't have<br />thanks to Amazon Prime<br />it was great series!
1,Gotta have this movie
1,"More eps please. I enjoyed this, especially with Bruce. Excellent."
1,Extremely well put together.
1,Addicting show!!! Love it
1,Watch them all thy are great.
1,Loved it. Sorry it ended
1,"Great show, good memories"
1,Denzel is always a treat to watch and never lets his audience down.
1,Fun night.
1,Interesting story. Some of interactions between Molly and John are not realistic and frankly boring.
1,The superb acting captures captures transports the viewer to an exciting place in time where every detail is vivid and real.
1,"As a 65 year old, I was enchanted with this film both aesthetically and intellectually. I was aware of the selkie legend, but this tale was far more reaffirming of human relationships."
1,Fantastic series.
1,Down and Dirty film with amazing sets and visuals.  Acting is flawless and it is real life.  A must see if love real life.
1,LOVE IT
1,This is one of the best shows on television today!! Definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys spy shows
1,Good show
1,interesting enough to keep watching thru the season.
1,Good movie all around.  Caution to those that don't like movies that get bloody as this one does for sure.  Good movie nad the story is good.
1,Love Lewis and Hathaway!!!
1,Still enjoy the series although it continues to be a compilation of all the too familiar story lines of previous sci fi flicks.  It is a pleasant way to spend an hour of TV watching.
1,One word - addictive.
1,Too dark
0,"My sister lives just south of where most was filmed, so lots of things recognizable. Acting and story weak at best, but was a family story! No profanity...."
1,Awesome
0,I hated this one.
1,"So smart, original and well cast"
1,24 is the best Series ever made.
1,Love it!  Hope there are more seasons to come!
1,This is the best series I have ever watched. Nova's topical issues are the key to it success. They educate and entertain. My favorite the rebuilding of  The New World Trade Tower after 911 and the thought process that went into not only the building of its new architecture  but also how to memorialize the death and devastation.  I guarantee one will not be disappointed.
1,"Excellent, can't wait for season 3."
1,Do not want it to end.Great show
1,Watched the last two episodes and immediately jumped to Season 3!
1,"A decent update to the original movieâ€¦call it nostalgia or whatever, but I still liked the original better, if for no other reason than Dawn Wells' uncredited appearance (Mary Anne from Gilligan's Island)"
1,Great movie
1,I really like this show a look forward to watching it each week.
1,"Not much of a plot to this one, but lots of naked bodies."
1,Awesome!  Where is the rest of the episodes?  Loved it!
1,"A good bottle of Valpolicella, some pasta and sugo and you're good to go.<br />Set in northern Italy, thee fog and chill is felt, the scripts are great and the acting is<br />molto beni.<br />Can't miss."
1,We really have enjoyed this serious. Looking forward to the next. NOT FOR KIDS though.
0,"We think Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, but could not watch this movie because of the profanity. We barely started the movie before we turned it off."
1,Awesome. Keeps you at the end of your seat.
1,make them an hour long! so much talent cut so short.  Emily is the star of this show and everyone knows it!
1,Loved Part two.<br />A real tear jerker but in a good way.
1,"Crazy, amazing binge watching series!!"
1,"Great series, I can watch it over and over !!!"
1,Great series!
1,Reminisce over the old StarTrek Series with nice new Digital Effects.
1,Best Sherlock I've seen.
1,It's good.
1,Just OK
1,Funny af
1,surprisingly good
1,"I love this movie, good plot, decent action, it was worth watching!!!!"
1,Don't know what made me watch this series but I was hooked after the first episode.  Loved it!  Couldn't get enough of it and was so sad when I ran out of episodes.  Fell in love with Nucky!
1,"This is my go to show when I am feeling down. Sweet little puppies in HD, frolicking, howling, playing with other animals; it doesn't get better on a bad day than that!"
0,Lame
1,Great!
1,Never heard of this movie before seeing it. What a great surprise! Bring your tissues.
1,Great T.V.!
1,"Good movie, great ending to it all"
1,"real dialogue, superb acting."
1,"Previous seasons were better, but season 4 is still worth watching."
1,Laugh out loud!!!
1,We love it!
1,"I wasn't sure I'd like this at first, but it's good. Suspenseful. Good main characters."
1,This show is awesome.  I will rematch all 5 seasons.
1,"Clever and creative show, and very well acted for the most part. Lots of wry observations regarding our ridiculous economy and resulting social system built to protect it."
1,Probably the best comedy on all of television.
1,Very good film. The actors are very believable. The boy who played Peter did the best job however.
1,The movies fabuloius
1,I wonder if this woman could take on Ronda Rousey in the ufc.
1,My 2.5 year old loves Thomas
1,"It is a movie that touches you.  Not in the tearjerker way, but in the slow burn when you realize you are all the characters."
1,"Fantastic series, especially for long time music lovers.  Even my 14 year old loves it.  Lots of history and good music with a good ending to see how the song was created for each city.  Watched a few of them two and three times."
1,"Great show,"
1,"Interesting history, but not particularly will told"
1,"I passed out 15-20 min into it, I think the gf made it 45 min"
1,"It was factual, but I didn't find it fascinatingly presented."
1,"Outstanding pilot.  Great cast, great production quality, great storyline.  I hope this gets made into a series."
1,"This video is very instructive, There is nothing like it. For the dancer, it is essential and great to hear Suki and Merrill talk about instruction that Balanchine had given them as dancers, Suki is delightful although her French accent can be hard to understand as she rattles ballet terms. The moves are also demonstrated by students who later became company dancers. For the ballet aficionado like myself, these tapes have provided me with a wealth of information about jumps that I failed to get from books. In the two volumes, the jumps are divided into five sections: one foot to one foot, one foot to two feet, two feet to one foot, etc. I saw Meryl dance (always wonderfully) many times and it is a treat to see her demonstrate that technique that made her in her time an unequally fast dancer. Definitely 5 stars and if I could I would give Merrill and Suki many hugs."
1,Love this show!
1,"This stand up is really funny. Totally clean, 0 offensive language/subject matter whatsoever.  You could confidently show this to little children or your elderly grandparents, and bust your sides laughing with them.  The bit about the Big Four show/elderly metalheads has me rolling on every repeated listen.  My tastes are generally pretty raw, but this was great, man, and on the good side, I can show it to anyone!  Even an evangelical could probably enjoy it..."
1,like this
1,It was good
1,Amazing
1,"Great  movie, I am  recommend to all my family  members"
1,One of my favorite shows of all time
1,Action Packed!
1,The first one in this series was more impressive than this sequel. It dragged on way too long especially compared to the first two Hunger Games. Strange ending and the movie jumped around a lot. Liked the special effects.
1,"wonderful ,. We were hooked, but come season 4 episodes, we wanted to leap up and entwine Amaon with venom. Why? Because season 4 aint free; indeed, Amazon wants $4 an episode"
1,"Hilarious, laugh out loud funny!"
1,"Well made, well acted, well paced film about two estranged brothers, once a highly competitive doubles team, who reconcile with difficulty after years of separation in order to pursue success in the US Open. Jimmy Sisto, who developed the screenplay, is the older, more passionate (and disreputable) &#34;Alpha&#34; brother - David Walton his tightly wrapped sibling, a substitute teacher with a student minion, Joshua Rush. Initially nursing old grudges, they fight their way through qualifying tournaments (and a brief scuffle) as their relationship evolves from thinly veiled hostility to fraternal affection. The humor is mostly subtle, although Sisco laces his character's lines with plenty of F bombs. Amy Smart and J.K. Simmons are major supporting characters, but off court interaction between them and the two brothers is slow paced when contrasted with the realistic looking on-court action scenes.  A serious tennis fan or player (which I am not) would probably enjoy it much more than I did."
1,Another Solid Season
1,wife says it was a little morbid.
1,"Very accurate in portraying the novel.  A few too-many-Hollywood moments, but the story line is true to the novel.  I like it that Keira Knightley is a simple looking woman and not some sex goddess just to sell tickets."
0,Good plot but weak acting and predictable ending.
1,pure pleasure to watch
1,Great show!  We watch it over and over every night.
1,Great Show
1,"This show is such a great portrayal of New Orleans.  I love that when I watch the series, I see familiar faces of local musicians I have seen perform there."
1,Awesome..just pure awesome.
1,I love it!!
1,Little hard to follow. JS
1,Excellent!
1,Great plots. TOO much obscene language!
1,Awesome
1,Very funny both my husband and myself enjoyed it.
1,When does season 2 start
1,One of the best movie I watched recently.
1,I can't wait for more!
1,Good show entertaining and funny . The only stargate series that is good to watch
1,"This movie is a sleeper hit for fans of the supernatural or sci-fi.  As an aside, upon watching it again the other day, I noticed a few people from The Walking Dead are in it. I guess somebody in Casting watched The Mist as well!"
1,love this show... always a surprise
1,"There are a great number of different types of episodes, some more interesting than other.  It is well done."
1,"Enjoyed very much, please keep the good shows coming"
1,I would like to see more!
1,Well done but a bit slow moving
1,"Great series, I am still in the process of watching the whole season. Love ..."
1,Really good show wish this was not the final season.
1,Much better than any current westerns with the last 3 or 4 years.
1,Enjoy travelling with Rudy Maxa.  He has to do the ohysical travelling while I sit in my recliner and travel with him!
1,"This movie caught me off gaurd. It was funny, but kind of sad to. There are so many people like this guy out there."
1,"Well made movie - though many parallel stories, the Director completes one train of thought before moving to another. Star-studded caste."
1,"great show, great chemistry with the actors"
1,Just the most amazing movie ever. My favorite always!
1,Gotta love Charlie Brown and the crew.
1,"Love to learn new things and almost every episode had something I hadn't heard about before. I am not an expert, but I take a deep interest in history, so have watched and read a lot of documentaries over the years, and I was impressed with the research that went into these stories. I had seen all of the referenced movies, so the Hollywood Vs reality approach was a fun twist."
1,One of the best TV series ever. Great action and suspense in every minute. If you can watch one Series this is the one to watch
1,love that show
1,Good could have gone a little further.
0,not a prude- but crude to a point of disgust
1,I don't like the vulgarity but the humor is great
1,Enjoyed series very much.
0,it was horrible.. i don't mind crude but this was just ridiculous and stupid.
1,"wow love it all,!"
1,Awesome show. Cant wait to see what the season brings.
1,One of the best English Bw war movies. solid story and well acted.  The Army unit return fro Dunkirk iis excellent.
1,Luv it!
1,Book was better
1,Well Made
0,meh
1,Good but could have been better.
1,A little slow. But overall a good movie.
1,Great movie but beware - It is much more violent and darker then I thought it would be based on the coming attractions.
1,Informational
1,Good
0,Several unlikeable characters. Waste of time.
1,Excellent series!!
1,Better each season
0,Not Nicole Kidman's best.
1,Great show
1,We loved it.  Wallace & Grommit are great entertainment for the entire family.
1,"I use this in my Classical Philosophy class...a great introduction and historical context to Socrates and Plato, and an excellent historical documentary"
1,My daughter just loved the show and now she has the book. She wishes it would come on on a regular basis but for some reason there is only one episode.
1,Good movie.
1,Very good story with sudden changes on the characters keep it entertaining.
1,Very interesting and informative.
1,I love this show it's one of my favorites!!
1,True to the book! I read the book first but the slang of the time caused a bit of confusion.  When I saw the movie it was enjoyable. Loved Sean Connery too!
1,a Scooby-doo fan from the jump so when amazon offered it on the prime  I had to get it!
1,Beautiful & enchanting!
1,"one of Robert Mitchums best movies, and a very young Wagner, great story!!!!!!!"
1,Still one of the best movies ever.
1,An entertaining movie with a few good laughs.  Grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the humor.
1,Awesome
1,interesting story line
1,Funny and quirky.
1,excellent!
0,bad acting and bad plot!  waste of time!
1,"Remembrance of my childhood. Doesn't have the best plot, nor was it ever to be a thought provoking movie. It's quirky, but funny."
0,If I could give it zero I would. This movie was not good.
1,Thought provoking and engaging.
1,A great surprise.  Love it.
0,Terrible
1,it's ok but have seen better
1,Funny for kids and adults. I think it's a bit mature for my 3.5 year old though he laughed a lot.
0,Quality of video is low for SD ..
1,Extremely well written series!  Acting is superb and each story has substance.  Looking forward to watching the coming Seasons!
1,It is hilarious :) Great movie to relax!
1,"Very smart series.  Reminded me of &#34;Turning Point&#34;...the dramas behind a company of people who work closely together, but without being too soapy or unrealistic. Beautifully shot and love all of the characters."
1,"Great action, special effects were top quality. The Rock gives a great performance,  gotta respect his ability and accomplishments."
1,"I enjoyed Chicago Code - it offers some originally to the &#34;cops and criminals&#34; venue.  Chicago Code has good scripts, a very good cast, excellent use of Chicago locations and smart direction.  The Fox network has somebody working for them that can pick good properties.  I would have enjoyed seeing another 2-3 years of episodes.  Unfortunately, the network also has somebody who doesn't see the value of staying with and supporting a good property.  It's not the first time Fox has cut loose a good show."
1,Interesting movie
1,"Amazingly funny, fresh, and honest."
1,Good
1,"This is a kind of freaky movie, and as an American who knows little or nothing about what it might be like to live in a tiny rural Iranian village, it left me in a position where I had no framework from which I could judge that the movie was outrageous because realistically no human beings would ever be stupid enough to behave in such a manner.  So I wonder if the people in those kinds of village are really that naive/crazy/stupid or if that was just some kind of built-in prejudice on the part of the movie's writer/director."
1,"Slow, steady and obvious."
1,great actors and writers.
1,"Waiting, Wanting more. VERY fun show!"
1,This is a good show to watch with kids.  My 9 year old son enjoyed the show and I also find it entertaining.
1,I enjoyed this film.
1,Love this show !
1,Great movie with a message for everyone in it.<br /><br />Remember God's always the answer never the question.
1,"Liked this movie very much, streaming quality was awesome."
1,"Great show, keeps you on your toes!"
1,Good.
1,Best movie of all time
1,Love this show so much!
1,It's a great show can't wait for another season of America horror story
1,A+
1,Stared it all.  Enjoyed it after having seen it many years ago
1,"Very entertaining for both adults and kids, and good graphics."
1,"Not nearly as bad as I was expecting. The turtle graphics looked good, but splinter looked ridiculous."
0,Terrible!
1,Very interesting doc....I'm curious to find out what has happened with this huge project since the  revolution in Libya. .. I'd love to see the topic revisited. ..
1,the show is funny and fresh with characters that don't take themselves too seriously.
1,Better than the original. Could have used more character development. Disappointed in the cheesy greedy corporate theme.
0,"The only thing this movie has going for it is the cast. The story never really happened. It just &#34;was&#34; - I was very disappointed, especially in Emma Stone's character. When I see movies like this, I often wonder about the people who do the editing - are they too involved in the movie to see that it makes no sense after they get through with it? I was 45 minutes into it before I understood what was going on - I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but the people I watched it with were just as clueless as I was."
1,It was a good movie
1,It was a great film! I enjoyed the story. Only downfall about the film in my opinion is that it felt like it needed to be longer. There was not enough time given to really get to know the characters and feel their connection to one another.
1,too funny! wish they had made more episodes
1,Gaffigan very funny. The entire family can enjoy. .
1,Such a fun show.
1,"This was recommended to me, and I am so thankful that it was. It really shows the power of compassion and how people can make a difference in others' lives. Granted, the subject matter may bring questions to people's minds, as it is about three drag queens crossing the United States. It is given a PG-13 rating for that reason; however, it does take stereotypes of various types of people and turns them their ear. For that, I am grateful."
1,"Silly, pleasant, fun to watch!  A Shaun-aholic-- I can quit anytime I want! I just don't want to!! ðŸ˜€"
1,One of his favorites
0,Didn't really go anywhere.
1,This movie is great. The real reason why I really bought it was to listen to the song at the end of the movie. I cant find that song to buy anywhere.
1,My son loves it! Wishe there were more episodes!
1,It seems to have moved off from the original direction and gotten too sparadic.
1,Shipped everything on time.  Great Job
1,"Perfect mix of history and mystery.  Loved the characters, especially the whole Sherlock/Moriarty thing going on.  So sad there will not be a season 2."
1,It kept me interested
1,"Love this program.  Warm emotions, heartfelt and great acting"
1,"While not the best film I've ever watched, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  The story is the usual &#34;must stop the villain from destroying the world&#34; theme, but done in a very entertaining way.  One thing I still can't get over is the name.  Story-wise, it has absolutely nothing to do with the film, and as a movie piece, it certainly doesn't describe the performance."
1,This is really a nice show to watch.  Good acting.
1,The family watched the movie together.  Great entertainment... make sure that you pop the popcorn before the movie because you won't want to leave during the movie to make it.
1,Love this show
1,Love Justified! One of the best shows I have watched. My husband and I are glad that I happened upon it!
1,Good show
1,"A movie not well known,it touches your soul,Will Smith is fantastic as usual. Great cast and story line.  Make sure you have a box of tissues near by!"
0,Horrible movie
1,interesting. shows how a family can be torn apart when their world changes and they do not know how to cope.
1,Jim Gaffigan's comedy is fresh and funny !<br /><br />It is good to be able to watch a show that is funny and entertaining without being peppered with f-bombs...<br /><br />I will watch more episodes of the Jim Gaffigan show and I look forward to more stand-up comedy from the master !
1,A show for people with an education. It is great. Glad I could get it on amazon. As I had it before was by getting a DVD thru the mail which took longer than I wanted.
1,well written and played ... this was very enjoyable
1,"Great show! Loved by kids and adults alike, even if it was intended for a younger audience. That definitely shows at times, but there's something about the storytelling and the characters that is accessible to just about everyone."
1,Love this movie.  My family & I watch it every holiday.  It never gets old or boring.
1,"If you love period style books, movies or TV shows, then Downton Abbey is for you! It's funny, with just enough drama mixed in to keep it interesting.<br /><br />I love this series!"
1,Loved it!

1,"Another outstanding Brit mystery.  Intelligent writing, great period sets, likable main characters."
1,"If you watch this movie on an empty stomach, be prepared to have a craving for a corned beef sandwich, a craving to be satisfied ASAP. Although the main subject of this well-done documentary is the owner of Kenny and Ziggy's Deli in Houston, it gives an accurate history of the rise and fall of the Jewish Delicatessen restaurant in the United States. Thoroughly enjoyable to watch!"
1,One of the best movies I have ever seen.. Heath Ledger's performance is spectacular.

0,"He seems like a miserable person. I don't find a good portion of his humor amusing, he's offensive."
1,"Inspite of the non-stop violence and sex scenes, it was thrilling to watch and we particularly enjoyed the real-life settings and countries where the series was filmed."
1,Great show but has its slow moments and a few episodes which simply buildup another
1,"It's not very often that I get freaked out feel like I'm going to crawl out of my skin during a horror movie. However, Martyrs really did a work on me. The cinematography was beautiful, the story like was intense from the very get go, and the end it unbelievable. If you are a horror fan this movie is a MUST watch."

1,"Every season was good, its just sad that Fox dropped the ball and stopped making The Unit due to in house drama and politics. It only would of been better if Hammerhead wasn't killed off. Whiplash could not hold a candle to Hammerhead (Hector Williams). I miss the show and its cast of Snake Doctor, Dirt Diver, Cool Breeze, Betty Blue, and Hammerhead/Whiplash and Red hat.."
1,Love this show !!!
1,Great movie for the kiddos. Has something for the little ones as well as the tweens.
0,"My 3 kids aged 4-6 yo didn't care for the story, - said it made them &#34;sad.&#34; That's the only film critics that matter to me."
1,Enjoyed it a lot. Being home bound it kept me entertained.  I did notice how some of the plots seemed a little ridiculous in day and age.
1,I like the story arc that links the episodes. Much better than stand-alone episodes.
1,Very well done.  Fast paced and gripping.  Great cast.
1,Great relationship of the two primary actors.
1,I loved the show growing up & am having a ball revising these episodes.
1,Fantastic Movie.  I cannot get enough of Kim Woo-Bin.  To see him act his age in this movie and say and do thing a grown man would say and do his age was a complete turn on.  I just wish I  could purchase Friend I.
1,It was not great but it was ok
1,Season three...please??  One of the best kids shows ever!

1,"Fanciful and fun, Big hero six grabs your heart and runs away with your imagination. In an amalgamation of Japanese and American culture Big Hero 6 connects childhood memories of K'nex construction and robotic innovation. You'll laugh at the antics of hero and his inflatable, rocket-propelled robot and cheer as they discover what it means to truly be a hero."

1,Excellent series I would like for PBS to continue with it
1,"Fabulous story!<br /><br />I binge watched this season & was thrilled at how great the story was. I'm not a lover of rap, but this story is so much more than about rap.  It is about relationships- complicated, real interactions between the characters!  It's worth the time & the price."

0,A waste of time
1,"Worth Watching- but drags badly in parts.  The history lesson itself is a FIVE Star Story.  I am a retired US Navy Master Chief and served 30 years (1966-1996), yet never heard of USS Mason (DE-529) and her all African American Crew during WWII. This is a story that needs telling, unfortunately this movie doesn't do it very well.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre at best and that may be doe to a poorly written story or just bad production.  I struggled through the movie, more like a documentary really, and a poor documentary at that. I would give the acting, production, and overall movie a two to three star rating, but I did like the overall story and its impact, so 4 stars."
1,I have always loved Bugs Bunny since I was a kid- I can look at these cartoons over and over again- so glad I have a chance to buy them- the cartoons are still funny- like this one 1001 Rabbit Tales- Yosemite  Sam- too funny!- one of my favorite characters- I intend to buy them all
1,I am a big fan.  Have been watching TGW since it first aired.  My treat for the summer is to watch them all again.  The story lines are complex and well integrated.  The acting is superb!
1,Great movie
1,Very entertaining!
0,"This could have been a great movie. It has a top notch A list cast, good director, but the way it was written was very poor.  I am not sure what was worse, the way it was written, or how it was put together post production.  Most good stories have 3 acts, beginning, middle, and end. This had one long beginning that crashed into and ending in the last 15 min.  Character setup dragged for the entire movie. You could not tell if it was a homicide at time, a drama, or romantic flick. Any conflict in the movie was muted, and it just dragged on.  If it would have been better written and directed it could have been a great movie."
1,"Surprisingly, every bit as good as Inspector Morse. Good stuff!"
1,A cult classic. One of those films you need to watch at least once.
1,Bad ass!
1,"Love it, it's a show that actually keeps my attention."
1,Well acted but I hope our political leaders are much more capable than these counter parts. Very funny in places and well acted. Actually leaves you wondering about the possible stupidity that may be our political system in Washington.
1,"Show is great, streaming is not so good. Jittery and pauses,"
1,"Intelligent, witty, often suspenseful  and addictive."
1,"Excellent movie. Seems,however, to have lost a bit of the fast paced tension of the book"
1,Nice good pace look forward to future episodes
1,I Saw every episode made and was best series ever m<br />ade
1,Great movie! I usually don't like remakes of movies but this movie definitely changed my mind. The action & stunts were amazing! I would definitely recommend this movie. It won't disappoint you.
1,Amazing movie! We thoroughly enjoy every episode. What a wonderful actress is Jane Seymour. Excellent choice for a family entertainment!
1,"Very entertaining,"
1,Very informative ... Love the show

1,So happy to have found this obscure title hereðŸ’–
1,Great show
1,Fun for the whole family! Love this show!
0,"Way too many flashbacks making the movie much too long. Also, no chemistry between the main characters"
1,My entire family live this show.  I can't get the songs out if my head.  And that's ok.  ðŸ˜Š
1,Fun and sweet.
1,It seemed chaotic and unconnected if you weren't watching closely. Fabulous job overall.
1,I just love Ken Burn's documentarys.  Beautifully narrated and photographed.
1,"I watched the first 2 seasons of the Fosters on Netflix so when I reached the end of Season 2, I switched over to Amazon for Season 3. I really love this series- as an extended Kin raising Kin family parent myself, it is fascinating. Throw in that the dynamics of a cop mom and a vice principle other mom (the parents are Lesbians), referred to as &#34;The Mom's&#34; makes for a very captivating series. I was a little confused by Jesus's disappearance, it is a little strange- I will have to go back and watch the way it comes down in the last episode of season 2 and the first of 3.<br />For some reason Amazon isn't offering a buy the whole season deal on this so I have been buying as I go, kind of a pain but I savor each episode that much more as I approach running out of them."

1,Loved it!
1,"A decent movie that felt like fan service to Adam Carolla fans and given that this was crowd funded by people who most likely like Carolla and his comedy it makes sense. For the most part, you can pick out many Carolla tropes that have played out over the years on his former radio show and current podcast. There isn't much in the terms of new material, which isn't bad if you are new to Carolla and enjoy that kind of humor, but if you are someone like myself who has listened to Carolla since the Loveline days on KROQ, the radio show on KLSX, and the podcast, then it can feel a little repetitive. It also has vibes from his previous theatrical release, [[ASIN:B003UOL6G0 The Hammer]], some of which have been matured and refined.  It's tough to be critical about this movie, as I am a Carolla fan, but the truth is that Adam is a great comedian with a quick wit that is best appreciated as he pulls up quick one liners and funny comebacks in back and forths with guests on his shows, but as a scripted actor he comes off dry. I couldn't help but think many times while watching this film, that it would have been better with another lead. Many of the comedic and romantic parts wouldn't have come off so stiffly, and the movie might have flowed better. Overall, it is a fun movie, and has some great high points, but to be a greater success, Carolla may need to stick with his strong suit of writing and get out of the camera to give someone else a chance to deliver his unique brand of comedy so that a greater audience can come to love it the way many of his fans have."
1,Very good. Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie.
1,This show is the answer to my &#34;what's the godfather's home life like?&#34;. you only see a glimpse of what vito/michael were like with their families. i dont think vito or michael have like a normal no drama conversation with their families
1,"Focuses on the right to life commentary, but does not take into account the health (physical and mental) of the pregnant individual, circumstance surrounding the pregnancy such drugs, rape, abusive relationship, incest, all the reasons why a woman may not want to bring a child into the world.  I am Pro Choice so I was looking for some compelling, balanced, logical reasoning for Pro Life."

0,All of the actors in this movie are way too good to be in a movie so poorly written. So glad I only paid 4.99 to rent. The only good thing is it took my mind off of a long flight for an hour and a half.

1,Sad end to a pretty great series.
1,Good story.  Sometimes difficult to under st due to accent but I could feel and see the anguish in the family.
0,Terrible.
1,"My kids absolutely love this show! My 3 yo son was skeptical at first, thinking it would be a girly show. Now he wants to watch it more than my daughter. They both are addicted to the theme song. I really wish Amazon can make another season!"
1,Excellent show!!!!
1,It gives the viewer a close of a look of real war as possible. The videophotographers are risking their lives too. So they can't show everything.

1,"Really a 4.5 star documentary, but not the typical Spurlock fare so I rounded up my rating to 5 stars because it didn't make me depressed. This film goes back and forth between 3 different stories or sets of artisans. They all have very different lines of work; restaurant owners, knife makers, and pottery factory. The common thread of doing something that is worth doing well takes time is really, well, entertaining and thought provoking. I watched this because I enjoyed a documentary called &#34;Jiro Dreams of Sushi&#34; and &#34;Crafted&#34; is another good one about people who really love what they do."

1,This is about Hungarian Jewish workers in the Auschwitz camp as they are putting the bodies from the gas chamber in the ovens-they discover a young girl is still alive. She is still unable to speak. These men do what they can to prevent the Nazis from seeing her until that plan fails. There's a news about an uprising in the camp. In the end the workers are executed by being shot by having to lie on their stomachs on the grass. The girl who survived the gas is forced to run away but she's shot as well-she's the one who narrates the story in the end (it's a voice-over).
1,Excellent travel show !

1,Good movie!
1,I liked it a lot.
1,It's an entertaining oddball comedy. Don't go here for serious cinema or consistent writing and acting. Watch it instead for amusement and to ponder how much of this movie is intentional.
0,It's ok kinda cheesy!
1,Great
1,Really liked it. Can't wait to see the next episode.
0,Not Good at all
1,Childhood favorite!
1,Awesome series that keeps you interested
1,I think Ingrid is a incredible Indie performer. I first heard her music on Pandora (Eric Hutchinson channel) and absolutely love her music and lyrics. A real feel good performer.
1,I love the awkward humor in this show!  I think the two lead characters had great chemistry.  All of the dialogue was so honest and I really enjoyed every episode.  My only negative review would be that it is only 6 episodes.  I would have watched 6 more.
1,"Loved the characters, plots, the actors are meticulous in their ability go portray the characters personalities."
1,"Silly escaapist, teen age movie"
1,"Great to see a female star who is smart, savvy, and yet not above living a real life with all it's ups, downs, and passions!"
1,Great show - lots of fun.
1,Loved the book and the movie was terrific.
1,"Fantastic, fast-paced action series with plenty of beers, babes and bullets. Great for binge-watching!"
1,"The HD streaming quality of this movie is very good!  The clarity is very good, and the video retains a soft film/grain-like appearance so there isn't any overprocessing to make things too sharp or too perfect.  I'm streaming on a Vizio M55-C2 4K TV with calibration settings adjusted for great black levels/etc.  I was very impressed with the picture quality.  Some HD options really aren't that great of an upgrade from the standard definition component, but I definitely felt this one is a good watch.  Amazon has had this title on sale previously for $7.99.  So, if they take it off of Prime soon, and I feel the need to watch it, then I will not feel bad about paying $7.99 or $9.99 to have the HD version as it is good quality."
1,"My daughter got us to try SOA.  We are hooked, and binging as fast as we can"
1,"If you like that kind of movie, half horror half no real it is a good movie, otherwise you will not like it"
1,"Favorite , always like genealogy."
1,Excellent. Jeffrey Tambor  is wonderfully sympathetic as someone struggling to find his identity and find acceptance from the ones he loves
1,"We always have loved this series, glad to get it on Prime....thanks"
1,"This has to be one of Ken Burns best projects ever--and that is saying a lot because his documentaries are always so great. Even on topics where I felt I already &#34;knew&#34; the material, he uncovers outlooks and perspectives that traditional history books routinely ignore."
1,Anything with Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo rates with me.
1,I really do like this show and so happy that they brought it back for another season
1,Much better than I had expected. Great fun wifi story good acting good humor.

1,Great TV show
1,Great workout
1,"The love of a mother for her child knows no bounds.  I watched this film on Amazon prime .  I passed ov er it for some others, but kept being drawn back to it.  I originally thought it would be the typical trite and predictable narrative of mother and child.  I was so wrong!  This is so heart wrenching and loving on many levels.  I've watched it several times and see more each time.  I'm considering ordering DVDs for my grown children and grandchildren for Christmas.  There are so many emotions without loud gunfire or ridiculous superheros and violence.  There is so much kindness and love from all the characters minus one.  I highly recommend this for everyone except young children due to a brief moment of vulgar language from only one character."
1,Great series.  Incredible cliff-hanger.  Can't wait for Season 3!
1,A calming relationship story that keeps your attention
1,"Its ridiculous how people wine and/or troll on the internet. the walking dead franchise is by far the best writing, acting, and highest production values this genre has ever had and this spin off is no exception. The only reason not to like this is if you don't like zombies or violence in TV and movies. The level is high enough even to convince some of the people who don't like these elements."
1,Season four was interesting. I prefer the seasons that focus on the Baltimore neighborhoods with all of the dealers and drama. I didn't care for season two because it was focused on a different group of people and away from the neighborhood.
1,"It's great, sorry they canceled it"
1,"I thought I'd seen every WW2 movie ever made,well the good ones anyway so I have no idea how I missed this one. It's a very unusual movie as where the main character is actually not exactly the heroic type. He's not a coward by any means but at the same time he's in no great hurry to see any more action or risk his own life by doing so. However due the shortage of men, sergeants and officers he has no choice but to accept two field promotions which of course put him in the position to command troops. Once forced back into action he does do his best to keep inexperienced troops safe and does see much more combat. It's hard to review a movie without giving away much of the plot especially the ending so I won't say any more about that. This movie is based on a true story about a bloody and perhaps little known battle that took place after the Normandy invasion. Both sides stated that it was senseless to even fight this battle as it held no strategic meaning at all even if higher command felt it did. It's gritty and graphic, well acted, scenery is great, equipment, weapons etc as realistic as possible. I love a movie that takes your right into it from the beginning and that's what this movie does. From start to finish you find yourself trying to understand the main character while liking and perhaps disliking him at the same time. This is a very good movie and the fact that's it's based on reality makes it even better and more enjoyable to watch."
1,Some episodes are funny.
1,Solid flick
0,"I haven't been able to view the entire film.The vidio froze in the middle of the car chase scene.I wear frozen out,while losing control.The only avenue was to get out of the entire debacle."
1,"I really like the show.<br />The pods didn't phase me.<br />When I think the things are going south it pulls me back in.<br />I've been waiting for Monday all week.<br />Marge is hard to look at with her face surgery but she's a decent actress and she pulls it off.<br />Most all the actors are good, likable, interesting characters.<br />I hate/despise reality, crap TV.  I'd rather be watching Under the Dome than most of the garbage on TV today."
1,Very cheesy but light hearted to watch.
1,"Most television series tend to lose steam after four years, but not so Deep space nine, the third series in the story that is Startrek. Even after saving the Federation numerous times and going through every plot complication know to man, and a few of alien's too, the writers for Startrek Deep space ninekeep finding ways to keep you on the edge of your seat. From fights with old adversaries to going back in time to meet some of the original crew of the Enterprise, the latest season of DS9 doesn't lack from exitement!"
0,An overly modernized version of the original Tarzan theme.  It had a few good moments . it at least<br />didn't  have singing in it. But the space rock was too much even for a cartoon.
1,A little cheesy but worth watching.
1,Great show
1,One of the best seasons for sure
1,"Just hilarious. Ben Stiller and Robert Dinero at their best! My husband and I had a great &#34;rent a movie&#34; night with this one. Of course we've seen it a dozen times, but it's funny every time!"

1,"Louis C.K. is one of the funniest and seemingly most-genuine comedians of our day. His style of down-to-Earth, self-depricating humor is always a pleasure to watch. Oh My God is a great continuation of Louis' fantastic line of comedy specials. Life can be hard sometimes and none of us are perfect, but comedians like Louis give us a respite from the bulls*** long enough to laugh along with one another."
1,"Best series I've watched in a long time. Everything about it is amazing. Acting, directing, script, cinematography, plot, characters,etc."

1,Anything with Vincent Price is worth watching.
1,My kids love this show. And it's a wholesome family show so it doesn't bother me. My kids also sing their songs.
0,"This is really a poor movie all the way around. The storyline and script seemed like it was written by a grade schooler. The synopsis states '....accidentally prints out a DNA code that in the wrong hands can end the human race'. Nowhere is this stated in the movie, never mind expanded upon, you really don't know why the 'bad guys' are even after it. Bad script, bad acting, circumstances and events that just aren't believable - an example: 'hero' is driving to save daughter, stops for gas, gas station attendant - an old fat guy recognizes the hero on TV as being wanted by the police, hero goes to get in his car and leave - but the attendant has the keys and sticks tongue out at the hero. Instead of grabbing the keys, clocking the attendant, and ripping out the phone, this guy takes off running toward a destination we are led to believe is still miles away - while the gas station attendant calmly calls the police. This scene is actually worse when you watch it. Don't be drawn into the 'X-File' like cover art, that really is where any similarity ends. The 'Riff Trax' / MST3K crew could have a field day with this one....."
1,Love this movie
1,"Loved this series, burned through it in two nights!"
1,Top shelf entertainment.
1,"nonstop action and suspense, my heart rate never slows down."
1,"The lead character, Sydney, is an alcoholic, chain smoking, carousing priest who partners with a an alcoholic, chain smoking detective to solve crimes. Social themes are presented anachronistically in the 1950's setting, with the tolerance that is expected in 2015. The two voices of propriety are an overly stern house keeper and a mousy curate with no confidence.<br />It's unfortunate that a potentially good show is ruined by depressing themes. If Sydney's character does not turn sharply for the better and stay there, we won't be watching season 2."
1,"interesting complex personalities, suspenseful till end of last episode"
1,Good humor. Very funny
1,It's a great humorous show for the slightly immature.
1,Very good
1,Haven't seen this movie in a long time

1,A continuation of a fantastic series.  Binge watchable.  Must see.
1,"There isn't a lot of programs which can be funny without referring to jokes about sex, drugs and whatever.  This is one of those series/shows.<br /><br />IF you truely care about what you and your family watch, you should watch this.<br /><br />In fact  it is so wholesome, I am shocked that it is not on the BYU channel."
1,Great show!
1,"I watched this movie but forgot most of it, so it must not have made a big impression.  But I give it 4 stars.  I remember the acting being good and the theme interesting, but it's not up there with some of the similar movies I've seen.  I think it's good, light entertainment."
1,Exactly what I thought it would be.  Awesome TV series and Awesome Movie.  VICTORY!!!!!!!
1,Great girl movie
1,Love this series
1,"I missed this show in the 90's. So I started watching it and  watched all six seasons straight through... I just couldn't stop!  It was delightful!  Wholesome, sweet, old-fashioned, sentimental....all the things that are missing in today's entertainment world.  Yes, it was sappy and not very well acted, but who cares.... It was perfect escape fare...something we need more and more in today's difficult, complicated and often disturbing world!  If you want to truly escape....this is your ticket!!! (Bonus, of course is Joe Lando. who plays Sully.....  what a hunk! real eye candy! and his character is written perfectly to fill every woman's fantasy))"

1,"Awesome lawyer show. The script, acting, storyline, is absolutely entertaining. The &#34;smart-ass&#34; snappy dialogue is great. This is a must watch if you like the lawyer shows.  The twists in the story keeps you hooked."
1,Awesome and funny we love the Michigan tool man!!
1,This is an amazing show...it need stop be shown everywhere.
1,Awesome!!
1,"Excellent show - I couldn't stop watching it.  It's so darn exciting and with many twists and turns and unexpected events.  Very well written, fast paced, awesome show."
1,It was aigh
1,very informative
1,Very creative series with compelling characters.
1,it was cute
1,"Terrific show!  Compelling premise played out by a uniformly excellent cast. Fine writing and cinematography as well. Amazon, give us the rest of the season!"
0,"I have watched this movie as a teenager and wanted to show it to my wife and our 6-year old boy. The movie contained an off-putting amount of bad language (with adults, as well as kids, using words like &#34;s--t,&#34; etc!), meanness and kids screaming at each other, racial stereotypes, etc. Our son was quite scared of the evil crooks, a dead body found by the kids in the walk-in freezer, and the screaming person chained to a chair in the basement. After giving the movie ~25 minutes' chance, we unanimously decided to turn it off. Perhaps we'll try again in a few years, but even for adults this was hard to watch!...<br /><br />We love the beautiful Astoria, OR. Hated the movie."
1,it is an ok movie
1,very well written and acted! Really enjoyed it watched the whole thing over a weekend
1,I had read the book and felt that the film was very close to it. Good performance by Tom Hardy and and Naomi Rapace but it is indeed a depressing subject that shows the evil of the Stalin Totalitarian regime and the joy of brave people rising above it. Probably applies to most of these regimes today. Plot was good but difficult to follow if you had not read the book but good anyway
0,This show goes down hill fast after the third season. I am not sure if I can finish watching the 4th season.
1,Always a good movie to watch.  Amazing that it is available on prime!
1,Lots of actors good cars and pretty good story typically almost any family
1,EDUCATiONAL AND FUN
1,The song about the Suffragettes makes me smile :)
1,Love it!  We have never become caught up in a series before.
1,Great movie!!!
1,"The basic message of this movie is focusing on satisfying your spiritual needs will make you happier than focusing on satisfying your material needs. This not really a groundbreaking idea, but the movie did make me stop and think about my priorities. Ultimately though the movie offered little beyond that, as their examples of happy people were a woman in Denmark who moved into a commune, a man who gave up his life to take care of the terminally ill in Kolkata, India, and an excruciatingly long sequence of elderly women in Okinawa, Japan who were happy because they met each other regularly, lived off the land, and took care of each other's grandchildren. Obviously nobody is going to be in these extreme situations, I wish the movie had focused more on how average people had improved their happiness. The other message was that surrounding yourself with family constantly would improve your happiness, but I can't stand most of my family members, so what do you do then? Movie had a lot promise, but ultimately delivered an overly simplistic message. Needed more depth, and more realistic examples of how people could improve."
1,A funny and hearteakng tale
1,Like
1,"Intelligent, witty, fast paced. Written by Aaron Sorkin. Do I need to say anything more?"
1,"Hilarious. I thoroughly enjoyed the humor of this film. Guy Ritchie is exceptional on pointing out human errors, and compounding a hilarious story off of goofy seemingly-random events. This movie is one of the best movies (with so many different characters) I've ever seen. The only down-side is that if you've watched Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll be able to guess what happens next pretty consistently."
1,"Larry is a genius, this series rocks!"
0,Too frantic.
1,Great Movie
1,Nicole Kidman just doesn't cut it here.
1,Love it....can't wait for the other seasons to reach prime

1,"I love spongebob, doesn't matter which season"
1,Great pilot! Looks like another winner.
1,Fantastic Drama; well acted
1,"It was somewhat outdated, but for 13 minutes I enjoyed it."
1,"Season 2 has more violence than season 1.  The story line is less believable.  The acting is still great though, and I still enjoy it."
1,"Good show - focuses less on the shooters, and more on their relationships.  Plenty of action though, and not gory."
1,My kids love this show and it is educational.
1,Great show.  Produce more episodes.  Awesome cast and smart writing. It is hit.
1,"Not a five (yet), but better than four! I can see all the great stuff coming in season two, as they begin to incorporate more and more of the characters who became involved in the dealings of Walter White's world of insanity! I love Saul, and I LOVE Mike! Itching for Season 2!!"
1,Amazing!
1,This was some great stuff!
1,"This storyline has been told a thousand times, but the movie was surprisingly good. Nice visuals and decent action scenes."
1,Very funny show!
1,Hilarious!  Great find for laugh!
1,Best series on tv right now
1,"Like the Danish version better, but my wife thinks the actor is hot."
1,"I actually watched the entire series when it was orignally on air. I usually don't watch things like this multiple times but after seeing it was on Prime Video I said, &#34;what the heck.&#34; So glad I found this again - great series."
1,It was a cute movie
1,I was a little disappointed with the conclusion. But I always want a happy ending. You have to draw your own conclusion.
1,"Worth watching if you like documentaries on the obesity problem and nutrition in America. It is really sad how much influence the packaged and junk food lobby has on our system, and this film makes that clear. It has a good summary too, which is important in a documentary, showing how the food industry of today is acting a lot like the cigarette lobby of yore. It covers ground already covered, but it does so in a way that keeps you engaged."
1,"The plot - British hopes of using the best of British cuisine to heal and guide lives through difficult times - is an admirable and touching one.  The US laisser-faire versus British traditions notion was a bit less engaging.  The acting was quite good but not consistently inspired.  A touching, heartfelt drama with a bit of romance, family emotion and cuisine-driven living."
1,"When a comedy makes you laugh out loud, you know it's a winner.The cast is amazing.I hope I don't have to wait for more episodes.  Great Job Amazon<br /><br />Tv"
1,Awesome
1,"Very funny and well acted, however, I  think Transparent is quite sad and a little depressing at it's core.  Whatever Transparent is,  once I started watching I couldn't stop."
1,I enjoyed it but there was an episode that appeared to take up in a place that was beyond where the previous one left off. It was disjointed there and it took a while for me to realize I had not skipped an episode.
1,This show hits its stride in the second season. I didn't start watching the show until the 8th season was airing. I really enjoy it and my friends quote it all the time.
1,"Vintage X-Files, and free if you have Amazon Prime - How can it get any better?!"
1,"Good movie ,not all young people find older people a nuisance."
1,"This was a movie that I thought looked interesting when I saw previews of it when it came out in theatres.  It ended up being added to the list of interesting looking movies I never got around to seeing.  Big mistake.  Ex Machina turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen all year.  The premise is fascinating yet simple - An employee of a large computer company wins a week long stay at the companies founders retreat.  The company founder is a legendary genius who has dropped off the grid to work on some secret project.  The project turns out to be artificial intelligence.  His creation is the lovely looking machine like creation seen in the advertisements, so I'm not giving anything away.  The premise then is turned on it's ear as we are taken into the relationships which are formed between the creator, the employee, and the creation.  It is a testament to the acting and filmmaking that your beliefs and alliances get all tangled up and twisted.  Some people may be put off by a concern the movie will be too technical or highbrow.  While it does have its moments, there was never a point where it went too far and lost the viewer.  It is not at all like &#34;2001 A Space Odyssey&#34;.  That movie has always been a divisive wrestling match between people.  This movie instead manages to be thoughtful and thought provoking without going over the top.  The ending comes with a surprise twist, and it is perfect.  It is not at all contrived to make things fit into a neat little box.  The cinematography is wonderful - claustrophobic, foreboding, yet beautiful.  The juxtaposition between nature and technology are all around, and it all adds to the mood of the film.  Extremely well done and inspired.  Although it probably will be forgotten around Oscar time, the set design is fantastic.  There is swearing, drinking, and nudity, none of which is gratuitous.  Highly recommended."
1,"This was such a surprise.  Silly, funny good feeling movie"
1,"Daughter loved the movie, had to get!"
1,"A visually delightful comedy about a charming scoundrel in 18th century Italy and France.  Casanova, and many people he encounters are extremely intelligent and supremely self-centered, and they use their gifts to seduce, enchant, undermine, belittle, betray, and conquer (especially to conquer) everyone around them.  Madame Pompadour, for whom all these descriptive words are too mild, makes a perfect foil for Casanova."
1,"This film was unlike your typical film, touched a topic that no one wants to discuss, but needs to."
0,The family was a little too dysfunctional for my taste.
1,"As all the previous seasons, this one did not disappoint."
1,great buy
1,My girls love this!
1,"So beautiful, fantastic and respected shooting in Japan. Great Movie much better than I expected !"
0,Pretty slow and pretty typical.
1,Film noire with a bit of comedy.  A must see for fans of 1930's classic films.  Others not so much.
1,Longer version of the show
1,"Good TV series.  Better than most, in fact."
1,touching love story with a message
1,Outstanding movie!  Everything you could hope for in a WWII airwar over Europe movie. I highly recommend Fortress.
0,What is the point of this?
1,Predictable
1,Watch the show as a kid and it expalins why I love the art deco erra since thats the style the animators chose for the shows back round and vehicles. Thanks for adding this to prim video
1,"In the first five episodes, basic transgender experiences are shown...women's restroom, meeting old friend who isn't expecting the change, inability to tell your son, etc.  The lesbian scenes involving your daughter; sex scenes involving your son, just spice up the show...<br />Still, I give it five stars!"
1,Good movie. Liked seeing that cast in unusual roles.
1,I would like the series to continue!!!!
1,Movie kept my interest but was dragged out last 30 minutes.
1,Great show! One of my favorites!!!
1,Great movie
1,"Everybody is good looking, everybody is elegant, everybody is rich (or almost) but the story works and it's enjoyable."
0,"Simply put, I want the hour of my life back I lost watching this thing.<br /><br />Bad acting, bad plot and many scenes look like they were shot by a film student with a handheld."
1,"Scary, but thought provoking.  Too much evidence to support the theories that something happened as the war was winding down.  Too many people just disappeared.  A lot showed up in Argentina but many if not more just vanished."
1,Great movie!
1,Great pilot can't wait for more episodes!
0,Sort of funny!  Most funny parts are in the preview.
1,"Special effects were terrific. Loved the time travel bits. The script was poor, and disappointing. They could have done so much more with the story line. It was way too predictable. Scarlett's character made a single radical change from interesting self-directed, street-wise young adult woman to scary monster, and that was it. Abuse of her powers made her scary but why would using more of her brain not result in increased compassion for others, seeing the interconnectedness of all things, and mellowing out? That doesn't make sense. The moral seems to be that we're better off being brain crippled at 10% brain use than waking up the rest of our supposed potential, because there is nothing but nastiness inside of the human skull."
1,Great installment of this movie ether you love it or you don't
1,He is now Major Ryan and need not saving!
1,Attractive and engaging cast whose fortunes I have come to care about.
1,Fun way to unplug from distractions on a rainy day. Not a great thought provoking movie just a fun and entertaining teen chick flick.
1,Worth watching over and over again
1,excellent
1,If you like killing and sex this is for you! Modern day Game of Thrones

0,Very short.  Not worth buying
1,Awesome price for a good movie! Just keep swimming! This movie is great for the family. Dory is my favorite and I am excited that they are making a Finding Dory movie finally. Recommended!
1,"Really enjoyed all the vivid and beautiful sights and sounds of this Crazy Family Adventure.  I appreciate the Kirkby family for sharing the world with me.  I, for one, am an introverted type who views the world with uncertainty and even fear and to see them boldly going out and interacting with (for the most part) accommodating and friendly people all over the world gives me hope in humanity."
1,"It was good, I would recommend it to friends to watch."

1,Excellent movie. Lots of action
1,"My husband, son & daughter-in-law plan to walk part of El Camino in a couple of weeks.  We had heard &#34;The Way&#34; would help them know what to expect on t heir walk.  Although we first viewed it for information, we were so touched by the message.  We highly recommend it to anyone."
1,"I love this movie, I watch the 1st season and was happy to see that there would be a 2nd one. I hope this turns out to be one of those 4,5,and 6 series, I will be there watching you can count on that! This is a great movie if you like space and sci-fi, the actors are great."
1,I love this show. It's quirky and funny. My husband and I laugh alot while watching it.
1,I love the actors.  Started out funny.  Turned serious and thoughtful.  Good movie.  These actors are superb.  Got a little somber and negative towards end but all ends well (Spoiler).
1,Love this show! Bring on season FOUR!!
1,My husband is hooked... and this is a man who watches ZERO television otherwise... what more need I say! :)
1,Good western
1,Great character study with of opposite people who meet under impossible circumstances and come to like each other despite overwhelming odds against it. The dynamic between these two people is interesting as it unfolds on a drive from the east to west coast. Slow but thoughtful. Recommended..
1,Very interesting and enjoyable
1,I love it and better see more!!!!!!!!!!!!  Freaked out when i realized it was the only episode.
1,Good movie..
1,"Basic video Guide to travel around NYC, it feels outdated tho."
1,Wonderful acting with never boring drama.
1,"Ridiculous that they stopped at season 2.  Best series of the Stargate franchise by far, hands down."
1,Good movie.
1,Great film ... Jason Statham a great nemesis for Vin Deisel and a very touching tribute to the late Paul Walker... All combine to make a thrilling film with a heart of Gold.
1,"The intensity of this drama is the real story, not the crimes committed."
1,There is no such thing as a bad season of NCIS.
1,very nice
0,Not very interesting!
1,This has been an extraordinary series. I do hope you stream season 3. This show gets 6 stars from me. Aaron Sorkin is a genius!

1,Totally got sucked in to it. Super enjoyable. So muchmor ethen I thought it was.

1,Love love love it
1,Always amazing! Love Disney and mr incredible
1,"Interesting, but lots of redundancy..."
0,The dialog was too corny.
1,"So far I'm loving this series.  The pilot is a slow burn, following a family dealing with personal problems; but it's set against the backdrop of the start of the zombie apocalypse.  Episode 2 it really starts to get into the action with civil unrest breaking out."
1,"Little odd,but ok"
1,Great movie
1,Good film- very real - B.Cannavle is really good. Loved seeing him as the main character for a change.
1,Amazing! I can't believe there is only one more season left! So sad!
1,Exciting series
1,A movie to be thinking about in a world consumed by greed. Because this is the true message that we should live by from our start of life to our passing.
1,Every episode funnier than the next
1,Good but not great...too slow and not enough of his artwork was shown
1,Can't touch Band of Brothers.
0,Sad. Boring

1,This movie based on the book is one of my favorites.
1,"Funny, cute, slapstick"
1,Nice movie but kinda odd love story....
1,"Still watching, but Molly TRANSFORMING into ALIEN? Really?"
1,Amazing show! Season 2 is waaay better than season 1; and season 1 was really good! I love the dynamic between Molly and J.D.!
1,"Any movie with this  group of actors/actresses can't miss.  As a retired person I guess I can relate more than younger folks.  Have never had a real interest in traveling to India, but this movie may just make me want to go.  Love the first version and this Second one is equally terrific."
1,Love it hunty!
0,"The direction, editing, and production values of the pilot were surprisingly amateurish. It felt more like a good student film than a major production. Except for the very first scene, the whole thing felt cheap and choppy. Even the incidental music was poorly (I.e., too often) used. The story is good enough -- setting up what's about to come. Acting was mixed.<br /><br />It's impossible for me not to compare this to the Walking Dead pilot -- and the WD pilot was vastly superior on nearly all counts. I'll watch the second episode of FTWD in hopes of improvement."
1,It was okay.  N
0,Pretty stupid
0,"Warning ......Geezer review!!<br />This show is an exploitive, redundant, inane trite piece of garbage.<br />Using foul lanuage and every kind of human sexual relationship as shock value to disguise the dearth of talent of everyone involved. You deserve better.. try twilight or 'Sales Lot for fun with vampires<br />Using cheap thrill to disguise"
1,This was so cool. It was like a grass roots 'how it's made.'
1,if you only focus on the sex you wont get the storey behind it all - books are better but enjoyed the movie very much
1,Great season. Cant stop watching it. Every episode just leaves you wanting more.
1,"Watch episode one (the pilot). By the end, I was hooked!"
0,"When you read the description of this movie you see a strong woman who knows her way around the logging industry, who just happens to marry a guy that has a troubling past. You make the mistake of filling in the blanks here. You think: A. they are going to struggle and work this out, or B. they will get a divorce but she still survives and thrives.... Well, you would be wrong.<br />  I am not going to give away the ending... I am just going to say there is NO redemption in this movie. It ends tragically... If you want a tail of strength and redemption this is not the one to watch... I was really disappointed."
1,I love being able to catch up on the episodes  that I missed.
1,Loved this show as a kid and now my kids love it too.  Great for families.
1,Very cute childrens show! My daughter enjoys this show.
0,"SPOILER (this is the opening scene):<br /><br />The camera pans up and across the crest of a small rise.  The smoking and burning silhouettes of tanks cover a debris-ridden battlefield, including a couple of Panther tanks.  A Sherman tank sits amongst the wreckage.  All is quiet.  Into this scene rides some German (officer?) on a white horse leisurely clip clopping along.  &#34;Do-dee-do-dee-do, just out for a morning ride.  Good thing we must have cleared this battlefield and pushed the Americans way back so I can just plod along here with no real purpose or concern.  Nothing to worry about here.&#34;  &#34;Iii-eeeee!!!!&#34;  From out of the shadows of the top of the Sherman, a wild man vaults onto the horseman, propels them both to the ground, and then stabs the horseman deep into the eye as the camera goes in for a closeup.  After pulling his knife out, we see the ambusher is none other than Brad Pitt.  He mumbles some stuff, pats the horse on the head and then hops back on the Sherman and climbs in.  We quickly discern his tank was disabled in the battle and the crew is hiding inside trying to get it fixed.  Good thing Brad took care of the only person on either side curious about how the battle came out or these guys might be in a world of trouble.<br /><br />A few war crimes presented as standard operating procedure, some more odd events, and multiple f-bombs later, we get to an improbable battle at the end and we're done - bringing it all artistically together by showing a white horse again."
1,"Loved it, great writing, great acting, so good it made me want to watch multiple episodes at a time..."
1,I love those guys
1,It's the walking dead. It's awesome. Need I say more.
1,"This is interesting, some history to learn about England and the Suez Canal crisis. It is fast paced and at first difficult to follow but after the first episode, does slow down a little."
1,Awesome! Exciting all the way till the end
1,good
1,I loved it
0,Bad acting - no plot. This is commming from a car lover - and a fast and the furious lover. This was my least favorite of all FF films...
1,"Never knew this show even existed, gives you a good idea on what corruption is inside of prison."
1,"Love have decent, true stories for the kids to watch!"
0,"Booooring.  Self indulgent. Mind numbingly sophomoric. This is the kind of movie that you feel lost and confused while watching, then right after you can only say, &#34;wow, that wasn't really all that good.&#34;  Then, days later you keep thinking about it and realizing more more all the ways that it was bad and you get more angry about the time lost just watching the damn thing.  Don't. Watch. This. Movie."
1,We LOVE this show!!!
1,Have been having a great time watching Amazon. This was one of my favorite shows.
1,The addition of Richard Armitage as the Red Dragon made this series for me.
1,We really enjoy this series!  It complex and well written.
1,Great!!!
1,Great show
1,Interesting but moves a little slow
1,Very very funny and entertaining
1,My daughter thought it was great. Good adventure.
1,"great show, I'm hooked"
1,Very enjoyable.  So hope there is a Season 2.
1,"Best show ever, Period"
1,"It gets a little slow at about 2/3 the way through, but hang in there and it gets better.  Very interesting story."
1,Love Justified!!
1,Don't have much time for a lengthy review but this movie was a great film. Superbly done. Would definitely watch it again.
1,Its a pretty funny movie if you like stupid humor
1,I enjoy it
1,Fantastic! Each episode was a fountain of knowledge and beautifully portrayed. Well worth watching.
1,averageâ€‹
1,I was slightly disappointed with the ending but overall the movie was evocative and good cinema.
1,Husband and I both loved it. Keira was fantastic with the changing emotions. Made me want to read more of her history.
1,"Great classic! Good plots, well done animation for the day, fun to try to ID actors voices from the day. My kids love it."
1,"A good film, glad I saw it, and recommend seeing it at least once. Good story, good acting, pretty to look at. A bit jumpy - jumps back and forth in time as a lead-up to the answer to the mystery of what really happened. Cheers."
1,No sex.. nice for a change
1,This is an excellent series!  Watched season 1 via Hulu and immediately cancelled my Hulu account: too many commercials.  Amazon Instant Video is so much better.
0,VERY POOR RECEPTION!!!!
1,"Completely outrageous and ridiculous in every way. Full of holes in logic and action scenes that defy the laws of physics. The dialogue sounds like it's written by a third grader, and the fight scenes appears even less feasible/realistic than those in the WWE. All in all, everything a Fast & Furious movie should be! Lacks some of the relationship emotion of the 6th installment, but the fitting salute to Mr. Walker at the end leaves the emotions satisfied."
1,This was just the promo.<br />I wish this was free with Amazon Prime :(
1,Great to see actual historic footage.
0,Did not wnjoy
0,Not worth rent price
1,I consider this sort of the prequel to NCIS which I am a fan favorite
1,This is a great show.  Entertaining
1,I really like it.  I learn a lot.
1,Entertaining - gets better as season progresses.
1,"I really enjoyed the development of the story in season 2. Hopefully, this show will not get cancelled too soon as most sci-if Shows do."
0,Really dumb!  I could only what a bit of it before I had to stop.  Painful.
1,"Love it, Love it.  Well written."
1,"David Tennent plays a defense barrister who has never lost a case, and in legal circles is dubbed 'The Escape Artist', the title is somewhat confusing and doesn't do the show justice.  Tennent's latest client is a psychopath being tried for murder, the case is dismissed on a technicality and Tennant finds himself and his family on the receiving end.  To use a hackneyed term - it's gripping and beautifully acted"
1,I can't really give a fair analysis of this film since I feel asleep two different times while trying to watch it.
1,Awesome.
0,"Save your money and watch Liam in one of the 3 Taken series.  This was a total washout.  Hapless police, two key roles both on a suicide mission, a professional assassin that all of the sudden can't shoot straight with his laser sighted pistol, but instead uses a tree for target practice to drain his clip instead of patiently waiting....."
1,Great show. Love to learn about the settling of the west!
1,love it
1,"I have great expectations for this series. How can this possibly be as good as Breaking Bad? Probably can't, but it has two of the characters I loved most, Saul and Mike. How often do you grieve for a professional crook and sometimes murderer? That was Mike. And the shyster? One of the best comic characters in any series ever, played by a consummate actor, Bob Odenkirk. Same director and writing team. Let's go!"
1,"Pretty good story, but the weird flashbacks were not necessary."
1,Could have been a good movie but drifted.  Could not hold interest consistantly
0,Very slow and boring. All men in it are treated like caricatures
1,A classic great movie!
1,A fun light comedy
1,"The kids enjoyed it, the adults not as much."
0,&#34;This series is a bit goofy characters change personalities and existence more often than people change socks. its inplausible and really hardly worth the time to watch it.
1,Excellent writing!  Can't wait for season 2!!  Great job amazon!!
1,Excellent
0,It was just okay! I am a Bradley Cooper fan and thatS why we watched it!

1,"Great for young kids, a little clearer speech would be great though I know that defeats the idea, but for kids it would be better I think. But the animation is great, and my son loves it."
0,Watch this and you will know what a 'B' movie is.
1,"It's a good movie, nothing out of this world but entertaining"
1,"This is a lovely story, our 8 year olds loved it. We watched it for our family movie night and our daughter couldn't get enough and watched it again the next day."
1,good show
1,Excellent program!!!
1,"I really like this show. It's kind of a soap opera with guns, spys and pretty girls."
1,"Good so far. I know the series was cut short, but supposedly most of the plot lines were resolved, so I'm going to watch it."
0,"I gave 2 Stars only because the movie isn't in English. It does have english subtitles, but I couldn't follow them fast enough...or they just didn't show up."
1,Great for my preschooler
1,As good if not better then the last!
0,Just a bad movie
1,We have never watched this show before and enjoying it every much.
1,Packed full of twists

1,Incredible show!
1,"Thought provoking and intense storyline. Strongly recommend, especially in light of current events."
1,Awesome classic!
1,It was great when first aired and it is still VERY great to watch now!
1,it was alright.
1,"Loved the pilot, very interesting version of what could have been had the Axis powers  taken over."
1,I saw this series when it first came out. I liked it then. The actor dynamics were great. Mr. Simon is an interesting actor to watch. I am seeing it again after so many years and enjoying it just as much again. This doesn't happen often.
1,AWESOME MOVIE
1,Showing something I loved as a kid to my kid and he loves it too is the best thing ever.
1,Great show!
1,Good old days humor and fun.
1,It was alright. Needed more drama effects but otherwise it viewable.
1,Great show. I can't get enough of these characters!
1,Interesting to watch.
1,Great story and victorious ending
1,Awesome show!
1,Good stuff
1,can't wait to see the 3rd one
1,Excellent
1,So real!
1,The Case Studies in Forensic Science continues to have excellent shows in their series. Highly recommended!
1,Another awesome season of one of the funniest shows on television!!!!!
1,Love that this show includes the family dynamic and how gifts can be passed on our kids.
1,First hour was like watching paint dry... gained a lot of speed after that through the end. Theron rocked in her character!!!!
1,"Love, love, love this season. Very violent but you've come to expect it. The twists and turns are coming a mile a minute. I have no idea how this will end?"
1,Still continuing to hang in there.. so it has to be good..
1,Keeps you interested love the show
1,I thought it was a sweet movie and it had a great ending.  I gave it 5 stars for family friendly.
1,"I love the actors in this, also the incredible photography.  Definitely held my interest all the way through."
1,decent end to a series just wish it would have been a full 22 episodes.  but good show our family loves this series.
1,Funny and Wonderful!! Anyone- from any kind of family- will love this movie!!
1,"Brilliant, amazing and beautiful!"
1,Absolutely love this series!
1,Love this!
1,"Very interesting, keeps my attention."
1,It's okay. different kind of story which is nice and shows a bit of British culture.
1,"This was a very funny, well written comedy. They do not make funny shows like this anymore.  Parks and recreation, community, etc. ARE NOT FUNNY.  And my demographics have the money to spend, not the punks who are growing up now and have no money."
1,So sad this movie did not do better!
1,"I am so addicted to Downton Abbey it isn't even funny. Love, love, love it!"
1,The language was kind of rough but I really appreciated the characters and their struggles. Especially in trying to do the right thing.
1,Best horror comedy ever made. I can't wait to watch the Ash vs. the Evil Dead series on STARZ beginning this Halloween
1,We've loved Backyardigans since my 11 year old was a toddler.  So happy to be able to share it with our 2 year old :)
1,"Very good, low-key scenario. I think you need to be an old guy 'near the end of the trail' to appreciate however. Otherwise, I would say you will get bored with this movie very quickly. It also could have benefited from more (female) nudity. In contrast to the subdued, restrained pitch of the story-line, more casual nudity by the female cast would spice things up a nit more. The brief nudity in the film was done in a cheerful, playful manner. More of that would have added more contrast and flavor."
1,Good writers keep interest peaked
1,"Excellent series.  A bit brutal, not for the week stomached individual.  Excellent choice of actor to play Hannibal.  He brings a sense of style to being a psychopath, if that's possible.  You can't help but like him.  He is classy and cultured."
1,I like all of Chuck Norris movies.
1,"Interesting, weird movie. .  something to think about. . .  Original idea!  A little far out, but go through the whole movie. . ."
1,Loved it! Well acted and a great message.
1,pretty good show
1,Jack Bauer!!!!!
1,"I was not sure if the series or the premise of the show would hold up after all these years, at episode 18 it is clear that this series has held up very nicely.  It is actually a big commitment to watch 24 hour long episodes."
1,Love this movie. One of my favorite movies growing up!!!! Loved me some Jonathan Brandis God Rest His soul!
1,Love the show.
1,Great show. Can wait for the next one! When will it be available?
1,I enjoyed the series.
1,Fascinating show. Very addictive and definitely for the forensic science enthusiast.
1,Grand kids really enjoyed it
1,Very well done if a bit predictable. Enjoyed it. Very good performance.
1,"Great documentary, but it sill leaves a lot unanswered questions."
1,"This poignant film spoke to me.  I remember my family mourning the Rosenbergs.<br />I was a little girl, but I know something very bad happened. Ivy's search for the truth reminded me that nothing is black and white, but there is pure evil unexplainable evil in the world.<br />Thank you Ivy for this film."
1,"my kids would give this 5 stars, but I am deducting one for the weird voice of the main character.  It sounds too old to be a little girl.  Also, the creepy Ted-looking bear and his creepy voice.  Really I should reduce the rating to only 3 stars, but I can't overlook the fascination for this show from certain household members."
1,A good representation of Tim Eva Mbeki sbook
1,"Amazon's current description of this movie doesn't have anything at all to do with the actual movie.  Amazon's description refers to the transgender performer, Barbara Herr, and not to the classic tale from the Henry James novel.  :D :D :D<br /><br />Nicole Kidman with her young fresh face completely devoid of makeup.  The divine costumes of rich fabrics. The beautiful gardens and scenery.  Great story.  Great acting.  Great escape from daily reality.  Great rainy day home alone kind of movie to watch so you can immerse yourself in the story.<br /><br />John Malkovich is the perfect insidious bad guy - soft spoken, manipulative, & completely evil. So good at being evil you'll still hate him when the movie ends. :D"
0,do not watch or waste your money.
1,Cool animation for kids.
1,my 6 1/2 year old boy loves this show and continues to ask for more episodes.
1,Season 2 was great can't wait for season 3 to be on prime. Just waiting for the next season to start on October 31st.
1,Very entertaining.
1,"Just love the show, thanks Amazon prime! â¤"
1,"This series started out really good, but I wasn't fond of the season finale. It's a neat idea where they were trying to take it, but the way it played out didn't sit well with me. Almost seemed like the last two episodes were written by a completely different team than the rest of the series and weren't nearly as good. I wish they'd have continued with the Greek mythology, and maybe followed the stories a little better--that would definitely have made it more interesting to me."
1,I enjoy the chemistry between the actors.
1,Good feel good movie.
1,Loved it.
1,Very enjoyable...I look forward to more episodes...
1,4 stars
1,Suspenseful story line with a good hook at the end of the episode.
1,Classic! And Anjelica Houston perfect as always!
1,Great movie....nice to see a MI5 movie instead of CIA.
1,Can't wait for season 4!
1,I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. No &#34;slow&#34; moments in this movie
1,This was a different take on the Beauty and the Beast. I was not a fan of this movie but it wasn't so horrible that I could not finish it. It was ok.
1,"I like the story about the Ludlows, but the first part was a waste of my time."
1,"Great movie, very artistic and well done. One of Our family favorites."
1,&#34;The Way&#34; has become my favorite movie. It has given me new insights into the pilgrimage of our life. I hope to make this pilgrimage with my son God willing.
1,Awesome show! Can't wait to see how the story unfolds.
1,Love every insane show. Larry David is perfect!!
1,"If you want to feel better about your own dysfunctional family, by all means watch this show. You may need a palate cleanser after binge-watching several episodes."
1,Excellent series with unexpected twists and turns!
1,"This is the best of the 3 seasons.  Fast paced, lots of activity.  Claire has developed into a very interesting, conflicted character."
1,"Absolutely love this show...so wonderfully written, the actors and actresses are perfect for their rolls, and the fact that it is filmed at Highclere, adds to the elegance and sophistication of the show.  It is the perfect show for the family to watch together...and to talk of the historical &#34;firsts&#34;, from the first electricity in homes, to indoor plumbing, to the automobile!!!!!!  It's just a wonderful show all around!!!"
1,Great show. Just disappointed with amazon for not just putting season 4 & 5 on prime.
1,I loved the chemistry between Rob and Sharon and the humor was great between them. I hope they decide to make a season 2.
1,Loved this show - both seasons. I hate that they canceled the series.
1,Both of my grandsons - ages 10 & 6 - loved it...not a peep out of either of them suring the entire show (seen via Anazo. Prime)'
1,decent
1,Funny
1,It holds your attention if you like the first 5 minutes.
1,Can watch it over and over. So good.
1,Love this show!  The humor is hysterical.
1,"Great characters, superb writing, excellent story, realistic and entertaining.  Have tried not to binge watch so I can make it last.  Highly recommend!"
1,Amazing show that runs close to history. Love this and would like to see if go on thru up to modern times.
1,"very dark, but intriguing... will be watching more"
1,Funny and family friendly movie. I saw it with my grandmother as a younger kiddo..
1,Love it
1,"SPOILER: Same film noir genre as [[ASIN:B001JYEMOQ The Talented Mr. Ripley]] and [[ASIN:B000IZ7YK6 Chinatown]] , meaning there is NOT a happy ending. A small town sheriff and a Japanese mystery writer work together to solve a puzzling missing person case. The writing is witty with several plot twists. The sleuths Sheriff Del Moral (Pepe Serna) and Aki (Ayako Fujitani) are well developed and charmingly quirky. Some dialog in Japanese with English subtitles."
1,Loved it!!
0,Weird and cheesy.
1,Love it
1,24 is the best tv series ever produced.  It's like watching a 3 ring circus with non-stop action.
1,Very well made movie. Inspiring.
1,surprisingly original little series.
1,great
1,Great! Too bad it was cancelled.
1,"OK, but not great."
1,"First few episodes were good, I thought it had real promise, but then it got a little too silly for me."
1,All the shows are so enjoyable to watch.
1,Love the books and so enjoyed seeing Harry's character in a series!
1,Loving season 3
1,"Loved this series during its original run. Cannot understand why it was cut off after only 2 seasons, but c'est la vie [o mort?] Really, really, *REALLY* can't understand why the 2 seasons are available on Prime, but the followup movie [released 5 years later, in 2k9] is a &#34;buy or rent&#34; only option; the movie wasn't anywhere near as good as the tv show, but provided a nice wrap for unexpected demise of the series. [Kind of like _Serenity_ did for the _Firefly_ series, in that respect.]"
1,My favorite show
1,Loved it!!!
1,I really liked this show
1,Blake Lively was very good in this movie. The story lacked a little depth but I did enjoy watching it a few times.
1,Not very useful ideas for my own social fundraiser
1,It is a good movie to watch when you're not sure what you're in the mood for!
1,"It can't really be compared to TWD.They are very different characters and settings. The acting in FTWD is very weak at best thus far,and I'm not attached to the show just yet. It hasn't grabbed onto me at all, but I'm holding out hope!"
1,Best movie ever!!!!!!!
1,N<br />Good
1,Clever drama. Good balance of humor without being too 'silly.' I enjoyed it.
1,I LOVE this study! Lisa is truly gifted
1,Awesome
1,classic....watching these seasons again is a pleasure
1,My wifes show and she loves it!
0,Not relevant in today's changed NYC.
1,Very enjoyable movie!
0,Slow movie
1,"I had never seen the alternate ending until just now. I LOVED it!! This is one of my all time favorite movies anyway, with the theatrical ending, but I loved it even more with a bit of extra footage and the alternate ending!"
1,"It's very interactive, which my daughter loves, and makes her think about what she's watching."
1,"This show has lots of soul, as well as being smart and witty.  I love it.  Would love to see it return."
0,Do not bother
1,"Our 4 year old absolutely loves this show, and it's a nice break from the usual chaotic energy packed kid shows."
1,My children love this show and it's not to bad.
1,"Weird, but in a good way. Kind of like Idiocracy, only turned up a notch. Might one day become a documentary."
1,The best!
1,"Great, touching, sad."
1,Good show.
1,Laugh out loud funny.
1,"My wife and I watched this non-stop this weekend. It was a very intriguing who done it. Just when you thought you had it figured out, off you went in a different direction. Very well written. The actors who I was unacquainted with did a great job in their roles."
1,"My 2.5yr old LOVES this show and I have to admit, I like it, too."
1,Good entertainment
1,"Great family movie. I had expected to be very bored, but would tolerate it for my daughter.  Well I my wife and I actually liked it!  Good action, thriller and interesting plot. Watch this with the family you'll all enjoy it!"
1,I'm hooked now. There is no turning back.
1,I hope this becomes a series.
1,Riveting. Loved it
1,Why do all the good ones get cancelled by HBO??
0,"I understand this kind of movie appeals to a certain group but the plot was rushed and lacked substance.  In spite of the frequent reference to good-old-days' ninja turtles, you get very little character development.  Dumb movie, at best, with a dose of fun nostalgia."
1,"This is a very good show, well put together and it keeps you watching because you always want to know what is going to<br />happen next."
1,Very good
1,very contemporary script---great acting
0,didn't like it
1,"This is they genre I really like. Themes that hit home. The story is fictional, the message is real."
0,guess I am more of a Clint Eastwood fan----
0,"First of all I'm a fan of the movie &#34;Loving Annabelle&#34;.  So the age difference I didn't think would creep me out in this movie, but it really did.  Couldn't they find an actress who didn't look so young.  The dynamic of the two lead actresses just did not work.  The older character acted more like her mom which was so gross.  The movie was also highly predictable which was another drawback.  I would save your money and watch &#34;Loving Annabelle&#34; instead."
1,My five year old is bug obsessed and he loves to watch the bugs &#34;battle&#34;.
0,"Not sure, can't figure out how to get it to my TV."
1,A very enjoyable and action packed war movie based on historical events.
1,"Smart, stylish, edge of your seat tension."
1,Love this show. Sorry to see it end. I want to see the movie soon. Hope it comes to prime for free.
1,Hilarious movie!
1,Great
1,Solid Season
1,"great action series, plenty of blood and guts.  The story line is pretty good also."
1,Unrealistic content but vidiography is very interesting.
1,Enjoyable movie.  Inspiring to see how she won over her husband's family who clearly disliked and resented her in the beginning and managed to keep a cheerful attitude in spite of so much opposition.
1,Edge of seat flic
1,"It's slow, but extremely vital to soak up all the details in order to follow #2!"
1,Grandkids love it!
1,Best year of The Wire

1,Anything with Eastwood!
1,Great show of adhd detective on the hunt !
1,I love this movie.
0,"Halle Berry has two emotions, concern and anger. Really poor acting. Story has become so predictable."
1,I can say it is one of my favorite TV show. There hasn't been a bad episode.

1,Great lessons for young girls - highly recommend - very well done

1,Another great series by Sorkin
1,I love it!
1,Great show
1,This was one great series and the stories were excellent!

1,Super series!
1,Great movie! Had to watch again!
1,"Good movie, keeps your interest"
1,The American Dream is alive!!
0,Language is absolutely awful!  I could not watch it.
1,"I liked the series so much, I had to be sure my housework was done because I would just keep hitting the &#34;next episode&#34; button till hours had passed by.  Glad the 5th season wasnt Prime as I wasn't able to pay for each episode. Will miss watching but have moved on."
1,Dark movie. Gripping and very well acted.

1,Very good movie as a sequel. I'm looking forward to the next installment in the series.

1,great movie
1,Kids love this movie!
1,Good  and entertaining!
1,keeps your interest with plot twists
1,The show is well written and the actors do a good job. Lots of action and some personal interaction. Sometimes gets a little &#34;soap opera&#34; but mostly a good action adventure show.
1,"Action packed, delightful characters."
1,"Somewhat interesting and timely story-line, episode characters would have benefitted from additional development. Regular cast members do not inspire long-time interest."
1,Excellent
1,Good clean show with great suspense
1,Still the best show on HBO ever.
1,This is an &#34;edge of the seat&#34; mystery you won't figure out until the very end of the movie. The twists and turns are like a bobsled run in the mind. Great movie!
1,"Beautiful story, setting and music."
1,Fun movie!
1,Seemed strange in the beginning but details came about to make it mysterious.
0,Didn't like the ending.  Could have gone on another half hour to wrap things up better.
1,"I know it is not a recent movie, but we reall enjoyed it."
1,I love it...bring it back please...
1,Loved it!!!
1,"One of the best shows out there! Sex, drugs, and Amish bad guys! What's not to like?!"
1,I like it
1,I'm glad this is on!
1,Loved it!
1,"Good story, stretches believability"
0,Acting is horrible. Actor/Actress selection does not fit well to story. Plot is fast paced without proper back story and character development.
1,"Just a little confused about the relationship of this couple. The  outcome in this love story left me with more questions than answers. Oh, did I say I enjoyed it? Because I did enjoy the whole puzzling situation this character was in."
1,Grand kids love this show.  Very creative and imaginative. So fun and educational . I like it too.
1,Interesting.
0,"Interesting concept, but the &#34;cartoon world&#34; made it silly.  Rotoscoping, if done, would also have been silly.  Would have been better, say, if the human actors were used with some whimsical touch, say the environment being a hologram. Also, the ending seemed weak."
1,Witty and magical I love this movie
1,Great film none better. I love the easy accessibility of your site to get great films.
1,Next Gen is my favorite of all Star Treks.  Thank you Amazon for making space travel possible without commercial interruptions  ((-:
1,ðŸ‘
1,"A little over acted sometimes, but still very good."
1,Great show..... sad that it's over.
1,Great show!
1,Fun movie to watch
1,The acting was first rate.  Very good interpretation of Flauberts' Bovary
1,Loved good versus evil theme.  Could do without so much sex and nudity though.
1,Love Grimm. Best show on NBC right now. Well worth watching over and over again.
1,"The movie was sad, but it makes you think."
1,"Fascinating story, superb acting."
1,"Kudos to the writer of an engaging and well-crafted story of self-sacrifical love, bitterness, and forgiveness. Now, if the acting could be as good as the script. Some wonderful moments were lost by the wooden performance of Redford (he was out of he element in a dramatic role) and the lightweight Jennifer Lopez. Morgan Freeman was, well, Morgan Freeman and his performance in a role that seemed written for his large cinematic persona was predictable. But the weight he brings to any role made the others pale by comparison. Decca Gardner (as Griff) has better days ahead as she grows into her acting ability.<br /><br />Josh Lucas did as much as he could with a limited character of Sherif Curtis, and Damian Lewis as the abusive boyfriend was appropriately malevolent and not too over the top, which is easy to do in that role. Carmen Manheim was, again, over her head in an otherwise fairly simply role.<br /><br />I haven't read the book but the screenplay teased out the storyline in a way that kept me interested (despite the acting) and surprised at points. There were a few forced story threads (making a to-do out of forgiving the bear that mauled and crippled you)...but don't know if it was better told in the book than the movie.<br /><br />In all, I wouldn't watch it again but there was enough to enjoy in the first viewing."
1,I really like Aaron Sorkin writings.  The acting and directing were great.
1,Great program! Can't wait for Season 6.
1,My all time favorite TV Series!
1,Great!  Looking forward to Season 7
1,"I can't believe how much I'm enjoying this show. I never watched it, and now I've blown through the first three seasons in a month and a half."
1,My child loves it!!!
1,Watched it while reading a book. If that'll tell you anything.
1,I'd love to see more.  Lots of fun.
1,I like the show because I think it is educational and you can learn a lot from it.
1,"Somebody had a &#34;real&#34; imagination - WOW, and able to bring it to the screen no less."
1,"Film enjoyable but not great! You usual man kills wife plot, in this case wives. Engrossing , had to see the end"
1,Way too long. Started out good but faded.
0,Worst acting
0,didnt do it fr me........
1,"OK, so it's a Ferrell movie and you need to watch it regardless of the review.  I give Wil five stars for just being Will. I laughed so hard in a few parts that I almost shat myself.  I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a  cinematic masterpiece. Grab a sixpack and any of your friends with a good sense of humor. Enjoy."
1,Excellent drama and action!
1,"Getting into yet another northern european mood - Danish this time. Really enjoyed this, although have had to watch a few episodes more than once. Must really pay attention with subtitles.  Loved the shifting prospective on the legacy itself."
1,"Again, fantastic show!!!  Great characters, great story line!!!!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!"
1,Was never able to watch. Now I can.
1,Great
1,Remains true to the novel.
1,Too much like the first one .Soap Operaish.
1,Good lessons for my 3 year old boy
1,Grandchildren AND grandparents thoroughly enjoyed!!
1,My 5 & 8 year old boys love this show and I like watching it with them! We are anxiously awaiting the next season!!!
1,Very good
1,Awesome movie
1,Great movie
1,after watching the trailers and even when it came to theaters i was not too thrilled but it was pretty good.
1,Very endearing story and beautiful animation. I love this movie. I can't wait to rewatch it with my nieces.
1,Great show
1,Hope this becomes a series soon.
1,Great show
1,Franco did very well.
1,Loved the first episode. Hope to see more of this type- I hate all the awful language in some of the other shows!
1,Matches the previous seasons for intrigue and surprises.  Just fun to watch.
1,I liked it.
1,"The first time I watched this movie was with my grandfather.  I was five.  At 62, I still love it."
1,"1990s series of P&P. Any version is a good version when it comes to Jane Austen. What I especially love is each production's varied portrayal of the nature of respectful behavior, the temperament of the parents, and the level of severity expressed in breaches of social etiquette or moral behaviors. This version seems to me to have a more  &#34;down to earth&#34; quality as compared to the more recent ethereal ( K. Knightley?) production.  Costumes and Mr Firth such a delight to view. Each character feels true and well defined as to be able to have a conversation. Get out your tea and scones! Enjoy!"
1,The intensity is building up. Love the storyline. The acting of all the characters are superb.
0,"Boring--we watched one and a half hours of the first episode, and it was slow as molasses. They had to spice it up with a totally unnecessary sex scene, at which time we quit watching.  A waste of time and money.  ."
1,We watch reruns and try to remember the details.  Retirement is good.
1,Absolutely addicting! Unlike any other show!
1,"I enjoyed this movie, acting was pretty good, twist on the plot which caught me a bit off guard until I figured it out.  Overall, it was worth my time."
1,"Shows  toll war takes on men and the strength , loyalty, and determination of one exceptional man."
1,Great movie
1,Well written and performed. I enjoyed the show and would have enjoyed more seasons.
1,"Song of the Sea is an absolutely gorgeous animated film that is equally enchanting, adorable, and heartbreaking.<br /><br />I remember when Big Hero 6 won the 2015 Oscar for Best Animated Film, and I remember there was an overwhelming gnashing of teeth from people who were all, &#34;What even? It wasn't that good!&#34; and I, not having seen Song of the Sea (or Boxtrolls, or Kaguya), was thinking that they were a bunch of sore losers and that Big Hero 6, even with its flaws, was a great movie with fun characters, quick plot, and good lessons, and deserved the win.<br /><br />After I watched Song of the Sea, I found myself in the camp of teeth gnashers. It's not that Big Hero 6 isn't a good movie, Song of the Sea is simply a BETTER one.<br /><br />The same storybook style that was so intriguing in the Secret of the Kells has evolved into something transcendent in Song of the Sea. The characters are very relatable even if you are not familiar with the Irish backdrop and the inheritance of Irish folklore that runs through this film's veins (heaven knows I was a bit lost with all that talk of Tir Na Nog and giants and fairies). The main character is a little boy who loses his mother on the night his sister is born. The loss breaks his father and induces the paternal grandmother to try and get the kids to stay with her, in the city, instead of on their little lighthouse island. We see how much the little boy resents his sister, and though it's clear that it's unjustified--she's a sweet, curious, and quiet little girl--we still can't help but sympathize with him a bit. This starting point makes his subsequent physical journey as he tries to get back to his lighthouse home from his grandma's house in the city, and the emotional growth as he finally confronts the wounds in his heart and tries to find closure to a tragedy, all the more substantial. You see real character development, and it happens in such a natural, organic way (even with all the fairies and owls about).<br/><br />Put it this way--the movie's ending is heartbreaking, whether you read too deeply into the symbolism of it or not. But it's also strangely uplifting, as though the whole movie is meant to be heartbreaking, until the very end, when sadness becomes acceptance, and acceptance into joy at a new day.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film to both children and adults. I'm not sure who would cry more: mom and dad, or the kids. My husband and I blubbered quite a bit at some points, but it was cathartic in its own way, so I'll consider it a bonus. I fully intend to add this movie to my hardcopy collection; it really is that good. Better than an inflatable robot hero."
1,"I really enjoy The Newsroom as well as most, if not all, of Aaron Sorkin's work.  The show is smart funny, and compelling and most of the acting is great.  The problem with Sorkin's writing is that it is so quick paced and intelligent, that often the wit is lost not just on the audience but at times even the actors doing the work.  It can be hard to follow.  I am a huge fan of The West Wing but The Newsroom, because it is on HBO, is able to bring a bit more reality to the interactions between its characters and that much is better than The West Wing.<br />If you like compelling drama and quick wit as well as superb acting by the likes of Jeff Daniels, Emily Mortimer, Sam Watterson, and Jane Fonda, check out this show."
1,One the best series ever...hits all the every day problems and challenges and situations of life with heartwarming moments and humor!
1,Excellent story but language was way too much
1,Very good documentary give this more stars than what I was able to put.
1,Woah
1,This movie deserves 50 stars
1,Can't wait till seasons 4 & 5 go free!
0,Interesting!
1,"Pretty good, I enjoy the focus on Superman and not Clark Kent. But the fights often feel too onesided on Superman's side."
1,"Love, love, love!!! I just wish there was another season or two!!"
1,Second time watched it !!! Just love it !!!
1,"The situations balance silly and awkward, and manages not to be too cringe-worthy."
0,Wasn't expecting the cursing to be so much. Looked like it could of been a great show but couldn't stand watching past the first episode because every other word was swearing. Sad that the writer of the series couldn't see that it would of been much better if even half the words were cut out.
1,Very thoughtful and mature material. Don't let Mr. Norton's self-assigned &#34;degenerate&#34; label dissuade you from enjoying this smart and hilarious special.
1,Awesome!
1,i love it
1,Miles Teller is a great actor. He takes what could be a cliche premise and makes it believable.
1,Love it.
1,IT'S THE NUMBER ONE VIDEO REQUEST BY MY GRANDDAUGHTERS WHEN THEY VISIT. AGES 3 AND 5.  ADORABLE EPISODES.
1,Not a lot of dialogue or plot development but action from minute 1 until the closing scene.
0,I think the writers are suffering brain cramps this season.
1,Loads of fun to watch it with the family
1,One of Eastwood's best and most powerful performances.
1,"nice and well told story, most of us otherwise would never have seen"
1,Great movie. Simple yet dynamic.
0,Could not get past the first episode of this.  Way too flippant.  Maybe it got better.  I don't know.
1,amazing
1,Lovely film.
1,"Typical of the genre, but a good story nonetheless.  Plenty of action."
1,Wife and i loved
1,very interesting!
1,"My son still loves it,he's 6 he's been watching it since he was 2."
1,Very watchable movie.  Would watch it again.
1,Excellent British whodunit. Hope to see film versions of the books that follow.
1,It's alright. It's worth watching at least once if not more..
1,Absolutely LOVE IT!!! Gotta have more!!!
1,Loved it
1,Son loves spongebob
1,The absolute best series I have ever seen.
1,Very funny and well written
1,"Awesome first season.  Wahlberg, Selleck and cast are excellent."
1,"This movie really sticks to its motif, which ultimately pays off.  Everyone and their mother has made a horror movie so it takes a lot to push the genre forward. Although I don't think this film will see the same genre-shaping effects of the found footage craze that Blair Witch spurred, the film's primary device (viewing the events of the film in real-time, through the monitor of one of the characters) works well and feels fresh.<br /><br />If you are worried that the cinematic device will get old, don't.  The truth is that it does, but you may find that it doesn't matter. Having it established early on give the viewer more permission to focus on the plot elements, and ignore the narrative devices used to communicate them.  This was a silly, ambition and fun movie.  I might actually recommend watching it on your own laptop in a dark room with friend."
1,Love it
1,"A very, very. Good cast and terrific writing!"
1,Absolutely loved this movie!
1,"Great action series.  The formulaic opening scenes get a little old, but the plots are creative and the action is intense."
1,Very entertaining movie.
0,Ugh!
1,"This photo for the program promo really put me off. It was my partner who decided to give it a try. This show is wonderfully entertaining. Complex main character with a roller coaster personality and colorful support characters, with great dialogue. A funny and sadly realistic storyline."
1,Awesome flick!
1,Great WWII story from a different perspective. Classic Mads Mikkleson.
1,"Pretty good.. I was actually enjoying it while watching with my granddaughter....,"
1,I thought it was real good
1,excellent
1,Really good movie. Funny and entertaining. With great actors
1,Loved it.
1,Awesomeness
1,"quite will done - protagonist is quite laid back which is questionable when jury trial could lead to prison  but, hey, good story line and it moves along with few slow spots"
1,Great movie!
1,Great show
1,The next best thing to Mr. Rogers!!
1,Excellent film; we really enjoyed it.  I'm surprised we hadn't watched it earlier.
1,Sorry it ended.
1,"Good movie, lot's of action, storyline ok"
1,Super cool series. Season two had a lot more twists and turns. More character development as well.
1,Great show
1,Great cast and movie!  Interesting theme which is totally current while the equipment is antique!
0,"I normally linke Whalberg, and Johnson bu this movie was a terrible plot, and writing."
1,Very entertaining
1,"My son and husband loved this movie. My son is 9 and just fell in love with it, and has watched it mulitple times since we've ordered this. He begged for it, and I finally got it for him. I'm glad I did, because it's a great action movie."
1,Good information
1,I absolutely loved this movie and these two are so cute and funny together.  What a refreshing strong female  comedy......  I loved it and it was one of the best this summer.
0,TERRIBLE
0,Nothing new here.
1,Good movie
1,just as good as the first two
0,"Dakota Johnson is the only reason this gets two stars. If you read the book, don't bother with the movie. Complete disappointment and waste of $6."
1,My 8 year old liked it a lot.
1,A very good series.  I often get hooked and watch more than one episode at a time.
1,Great Eastwood movie.
1,"This summer I toured London and saw some of the places where Downton Abby was filmed. Watching the series, I enjoy remembering the geography. In addition, in this series we are seeing changing times. I love the mix of history and drama!"
1,Like a great book or bag of chips.  You can't stop watching the series.  Captivating.
1,We enjoyed the episode and would watch it as a series.
1,"This a relatively decent movie.  It is an amazing story; I wouldn't have believed it if it hadn't been true.  But it was annoyingly predictable.  I figured it out after a few minutes.  It's worth a watch, but I almost stopped watching early on when it was obvious what was going to happen.  My curiosity and lack of anything better to watch got the best of me."
0,I wanted to like this from the description and seeing Samuel Jackson in it.  It looked like an adventure feel-good movie.  This was a waste of time and money.  It looked like a film commission movie from Norway.  The pace was slow and the story undeveloped.  The complete lack of any attempt to be realistic was lost.  US forces having an armada of helicopters on foreign soil sent in by our situation room that could not track a plane and generals that just hung their heads low while civilians yelled at them.  Film school quality at best.
1,"Good tv, you care about the charcters and what goes on."
1,"Unique cop-type drama.  British made, so that's always a plus in my eyes.  I've enjoyed Season 1."
1,"The second season was good, but not as interesting as the first.  I hope the following seasons are better."
1,"This is one of the best film about AI there. The characters are well thought. The story is just right and all the Computer Science goodness is mixed with philosophical goodness. The questions that this movie asks are already relevant and going to be more relevant soon. Still everybody can enjoy this movie and if you think a bit, it becomes more interesting."
1,If you have a dog you will love this movie.  It is seldom that we will both cry (more than just wet tears) at a movie but the story and the memory of our last dog just came rushing back.  Even if you do not have a dog or ever want a dog you will at least have wet eyes from this movie.  &#34;Hachi&#34; will stay on our Watch List for a very long time.
1,"First I have to say that I actually enjoyed this movie.  I knew that the movie had not received the best of reviews, so I went into this venture not expecting to be amazed.  I'm not going to go into plot details and do a synopsis, as many have already done that.  I enjoy campy flicks, and a lot of B movies.  This film was fun.  I would definitely recommend this movie to any of my family or friends."
1,I really enjoy watching this show.
1,Enjoyable
0,Just strange
1,"Season's 5 and 6 with the new character &#34;Joe&#34; are the favorites with my two little girls. The songs are catchy and fun, as well as easy for toddlers to pick up.  &#34;Joe&#34; is engaging and, frankly very entertaining to watch even for adults.  It almost feels like watching theater because of how animated he is."
1,Great movie
0,"Terrible movie, weird, drawn out, not a clear direction of a plot"
1,I love this show!  It is addicting.  I wish next season were free too!
1,Outstanding mystery.  Every episode left you eager to see the next.  Enjoyed the ending.
1,A must see.
1,Of the BEST series I've seen ! !
0,"The storyline didn't grab me & the protagonist didn't convince me to continue watching the series.  This show will probably get some better ratings than I am given, but that's because I wasn't as taken in by the babes & boobs that abound the show.  Casanova appears to mumble his dialog and we are to sympathize with him as he looks pathetically on as one woman after another is abused by someone in power."
1,Loved this! Laughed all the way through!
1,"Those Vikings are sumth'n, huh?"
1,Love it
1,Very good lots of bone-crunching action
1,Somewhat bizarre...but addictive. Update: I'm glad it is finished. There isn't much more they can do with the storyline.
1,best show ever
1,"I think this movie was trying to dove tail on the success of the great &#34;Heat&#34; movie from a year ago. While not quite at that level, it was still entertaining. There are some very funny moments and some near misses humor wise. While I was glad I didn't see it at theater, I would recommend it for date night."
1,"Quite a good movie, I do love Jason Bateman's characters."
1,good movie
1,My wife and I watched this with our 7 year old son and it was excellent! Kept him glued to the screen
1,"Ms. Margulies' character Alicia Florrick is very well developed throughout the seasonal story line.  The arc of her portrayal of an attorney learning how to operate and navigate in a justice system that is presented as flawed, where sometimes the defense attorneys have to represent the bad guys, is very well executed.  Her character has developed in surprising ways from the beginning of this series.  It is a testament to Ms. Margulies acting abilities that she pulls this off so effortlessly.  It's an enjoyable, and distracting, series, it will keep you engaged, especially if you like intrigue, where you're not sure what side to stand on, or whether the facts matter, or not...  Tastefully executed.  And, the character wears killer outfits!"
0,"It just couldn't make it.  I wanted to stop shortly after the movie started, but I didn't. Bad all the way around."
1,Too many F bombs but the writing is hilarious
1,Nice
1,"Somewhat implausible but entertaining, not the best"
1,"I'm sure it isn't liked by republicans. Satire, I think."
1,"I wanted to see this movie when it first came out due to the commercials. It was just as good as I hoped it would be. Good story line, great actors and lots of phone."
1,"I didn't expect to like this movie quite so much, especially knowing it came from the makers of Fault in our Stars - another movie I liked but which left me a bit down. This one did no such thing, afterward I was hopeful and upbeat despite the tragedies that are obvious from the trailer. This movie offered similarly interesting characters, very well acted, and a plot line that kept me thinking, generally enthralled, and entertained. Well done! I like it when the characters hang around in my head even after the credits have passed. :-)"
1,The story seems to have shifted from season one with no logical explanation. It's still entertaining but not as much as it could be.
1,Good fun and easy introduction to gaming
1,"The total budget is unknown to me, but 1,527 backers pledged $94,294 on Kickstarter towards the production of Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (MQH). Even if the total cost ended up as high as $3M, that's still a paltry sum for a movie that requires shoots in semi-remote locations, special effects in numerous scenes, and the creation of specialized sets, props, and costumes. The 1st Hobbit flick (2012) had an estimated budget of $180M, which is maybe 60-150x the price tag of MQH. Was the 1st Hobbit flick 100x better than MQH? Not by a longshot. That said, don't buy into MQH if you expect anywhere near Peter Jackson quality, obviously.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />âœ” Cinematography. Waaaay better than expected.

Christopher Robin Miller (Hammerhead), Adam Johnson (Thane) and Nicola Posener (Teela) have numerous previous credits to their names, and relative newcomer Melanie Stone (Marek) did an admirable job as the lead.

1,"A work of art. No one should believe animated films are exclusively for children. This is definitely, thematically, a movie geared for adults. It's a beautiful, whimsical story that is completely relatable on many, many levels. I highly recommend sitting down with a glass of wine and maybe a bowl of ice cream and watching. It's brilliant."
1,Worth your time.
1,I really like this epsiode & I really like to see more of it
1,AWESOME
1,Beautifully done!
1,"Very informative look at Edwardian society with the backdrop of the Downton Abbey set, cast and crew."
1,Best show ever!
1,I enjoy this series very much.
1,I will be watching the entire season.
1,I have read all of the Bosch books and have been very pleased with this series of TV shows.  They have done a great job of following the books and have done and excellent job of bring well written books to the screen.  I will watch the entire series.
1,GREAT WELL DONE DRAMA. EXCELLENT CAST AND CREW.
1,It was really good
1,"Wow, what an amazing show.  This thing keeps surprising you and letting you know just enough to be curious to watch the next episode.  No spoilers here, so I will just say that my wife and I feel like there is an empty spot now that we have finished this show and can't find a replacement."
1,"Excellent movie, great story line."
1,"Amazing story of the life of Robert Ripley.  Really recommended for anyone who has been a fan of Believe It Or Not.  Pace and presentation are just fast enough to hold interest, yet not get bogged down in the small details."
1,Love this show!
1,My mom said I'd love it and she was right. Looking forward to season 2.
1,Very Entertaining thats for sure. Not something you watch with young children or teens in the Room. DEFINITELY ADULT SHOW. But really enjoy the Story lines. NEVER A DULL MOMENT.. Each episode keeps you coming back for more. Just Sad the Show has ended
1,This author is new to me and a great find.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and ordered the next in the series.
1,"There's nothing ground breaking about this movie, but I enjoyed every minute. Must see for all horror fans !"

0,A pretty hokey movie that was hard to gw tg into.
1,nice show.
1,This series is sooooo funny!!!!  I highly recommend it and cannot wait for next season!!!!!
1,Thoroughly entertaining!
1,Great movie.
1,This is the beginning of a great series about the aftermath of Katrina in New Orleans. Excellent cast portrays several interconnected stories stitched together by the music of the city played by real musicians. As with any series events may seen a bit contrived to make points about the effect of the hurricane on the city. But the characters have enough depth to carry it off.
1,very Good
1,Gotta have this movie
1,Easter was never so much fun! Excellent and highly recommended.
1,Every episode has you holding your breath.
1,This is an awesome sci-fi show.

1,Well-done crime show with interesting characters.
1,Good stuff.
1,Excellent series
1,Very entertaining
1,This show entertains me !!!
1,"The first few eposides were the most interesting, as it continues there is just to much violence for me to rate it a 5 star. Unbelievable happenings, yet the human reactions are so what most people would do."
1,there was only about 5 episodes the rest were trailers not worth the 16.00 .the first time i did not like something from amazon .so no hard feelings
1,I read the book before I saw the movie; the book was excellent. It wasn't exactly like the book but it was pretty good.
1,"Well acted.  I would really have liked a postscript saying how much of it, if any, is true to history."
1,Great acting & costumes.
1,Love this show!!! I just love British comedy!! I always look forward to new episodes!!!
1,I liked it! Trailer gave away most of the good parts though.
0,"Horrible film in my opinion. The film starts of suspenseful but the storyline never fully develops. Everything is revealed in the last two minutes, leaving the viewer confused with the abrupt conclusion."
1,"Very good movie about the D-Day invasion.  While the whole story is much more involved, this movie showed most of the way it was back then."
1,The movie itself wasn't that interesting but just watching Robin Williams play made it worth it.
1,My almost 2 grandbaby loves this.  I also bought another dvd about a pig and his birthday because her birthday is coming soon and she asked to see Bubble guppies followed by NO PIG...so darn cute!
0,"Disappointing, so different from the first and so contrived."
1,"Good movie!  I had read the book, so I knew the story going in.  Might have been a better review, if I hadn't known the plot.  Really enjoyed it though!"
1,Loved this series
1,Still fun to watch.  Go Kirk!
1,Unexpectedly exciting! Brilliant writing.
1,"This was a very enjoyable movie.  It was very slow most of the time, but a very good story.  I will leave it up to you, but I did not like the way it ended.  Good thing it was on Prime, I probably would not have paid extra for it to rent it.  I do think the main actress was a very, very good actress."
1,One of the very best of the series! Love how it ties to the original series and movies (with some creative liberties taken).
1,Funny as heck
1,I've been watching  this on my cell phone for a week and all of a sudden it's not available  ton watch. That sucks but I love the show.

1,Drives me crazy with those songs but my daughter seems to like it.

0,So bad it made me angry for watching.
1,Good movie
1,Great show if you like SCI FI
1,Topics are sooooo timely.
1,"If the news actually aspired to this level of intelligence, it might actually be worth watching. Instead, far more pften than not, we get sensationalist nonsense that some advertising-addled producer's test group said would drive numbers.<br /><br />An FYI for all of that stupidity out there: sure, we commoners love watching train wrecks happenning in slow motion in other people's lives; it is legal heroin. But we shouldn't want this drivel. And you, Mr. News, put your ethical decripitude on display every time you feed our addiction.<br /><br />... So yeah, I suppose you could say I like the show, &#34;The Newsroom.&#34;"
1,Just an amazing cast!!!
1,Great series and script. Script writers must have an extensive vocabulary as they were able avoid the F-word in every sentence. That is a major accomplishment.
1,It's a good change of pace from the normal &#34; spooky-who done it&#34;
1,Great movie. I will watch it again. This should be mandatory for every high school as well as college student to watch. This should also be mandatory to be watched at least once a week by anyone who is on welfare or on any type of assistance! GREAT MOVIE!!!
1,If you love Bosch you'll love this show. ..very well done. ..his house perched on the hill is perfect
1,Very predictable
1,"Great movie, Christian Bale is incredible, he takes over the movie, you will like him or hate him, great actor. The movie is amazing."
1,"Great movie. Extended version kinda corny with Paul walker , but will be missed. Would love to see 8 with Jason stathon"
1,I'm glad I finally found somewhere that had the last episode
1,"Can second season show up already? This is one of the best shows I have come across in a long long time. Smart, witty, unique, engaging. Love the lead characters."
1,Good
0,Maybe two and a half stars.  Not enamored with the plot.
1,A great show.
1,Great series.

1,This is great.
1,Just a gerat heart wrenching movie. Hard to not shed a tear.
1,"Great, good clean show thats hard to find anymore"
1,"It's entertaining, though a little violent button no more so than many other TV shows."
0,"There is a reason for editing a movie.  I enjoyed the book of The Outsiders and realize that when a movie is made, changes sometimes happen to tighten the story.  This cut features extra footage, none of which enhances the movie.  Music has been added to quiet reflective moments, overpowering the dialogue.  Some scenes were even replaced with different takes than those included in the theatrical release.  The film quality is also poor.  Horrible."
1,Good clean interesting show!
0,Couldn't get through this.
0,Is it just a rule that these Indie films have no ending?
1,Awesome show!
1,I'm so happy you brought Curb to prime. Love love love this show.
1,What else can I say? It's a legendary show.
0,"I give it one star because the performances of Michael Douglas and Matt Damon were very good... The story line is pathetic, and depressing. That's all I've got to say about that!"
1,I love this season
1,Fantastic.
1,So fun. I wish they had made more seasons!
1,Awesome show
1,It is worth watching sort of.  Story is fair.
1,First R movie with a date - lived the life at College a few years later.  Way overlooked is the music.
1,Great show
1,5 stars
1,Good Movie!
1,Got too strange for me...
0,"Well, it was a kind of guilty pleasure.  the old fellow in the beard could barely contain his contempt for the Holy Catholic Church.  My favorite line was his insistence that the Vikings attacked England repeatedly not out of a desire to enrich themselves, but out of a desire to curb Catholicism.  Well, I think we all owe the Vikings a big dam' apology!  It was really great fun in view of the fact that he fervently believed everything he said, but it was badly made and even I can only stand so much.  Only watched about half of it...didn't really get the point, obviously."
1,Awesome show...hope it renews!!!!
1,Good show. Rarely a dull moment!
1,One of the best programs ever!

1,Great show for all ages
1,Thought provoking entertainment at its best!
1,The best movie ever. Great scenes. Thought it was all real.
1,"Everything was beautiful, yet sad. The actors, the country, the story. Saw it first in a beautiful palace-like theater, which was appropriate for such a grand movie. It left a very wonderful memory for me. Fell in love with Peter and Omar's characters - so sad their parting ways."
1,"No, really, you'll love it!"
1,"Hooked on it, great show!"
1,Excellent
1,Very gritty.  Believe the intro. Not your typical action movie
1,I loved the entire series.  Too bad it was cancelled.
1,Great!
1,"Well written. deals with true to life issues, great acting by great actresses and actors.The quality of this show should be a model for others (stateside) to follow."
1,MacGyver can do almost anything with a Swiss Army knife and duct tape.
1,"A sweet, heart warming story about relationships.  It is certainly worth watching when you just want to remember the good in people."
1,"A fresh new start to the Walking Dead series. Though the first series is still good, its great to see a new series with different people. I look forward to seeing what's to come! If you like the original series, you should at least watch the first two episodes before deciding not to get this series."
1,Too much of a bodice ripper - Aiden T should have a great future
1,Absolutely love this series. Can't wait till Sesason 2.
1,Very interesting
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, very touching."
1,Very funny
1,Love this show.
1,SO FUNNY!  Great for kids and adults alike.
1,Great
0,"Nice concept. Don't want to hurt someone's feelings but they missed the mark. Watch, but fast forward."
1,"I've been watching most of this series, primarily because the basic plot is so interesting; and I'd like to see how it all gets resolved.  However, I think the dialogue is often just unrealistic, not what any normal person would say in similar circumstances; and the acting is mediocre, I mean better than I could do, but not top notch.  So I'd really like to fast forward to the end, and do quite often.  It also feels like the writers/producers are saying, &#34;We've got a hit here; we need to extend the plot out as long as we can to keep it going.&#34;  I can't say as I blame them; but, again, I might just wait until I hear that the final episode is posted on Amazon, and watch that one."
1,One of my all-time favorite series.
1,I liked learning about the behind the scenes of one of my very favorite English dramas.
1,Suspenseful masterpiece.  Action packed with heartfelt romance.  I'm ready for Salt II.  So sad that it is stalled in production and may never be made.
1,"I thought it was compelling after a bit of a slow start. Altogether, it was really good."
1,I loved this movie. I've watched it several times.  I have long been a fan of the Underworld series and this didn't disappoint . Thank you Kevin Grevioux. Keep up the good work. (H.U.)
1,My daughters and I were surprised how much we enjoyed this.  The parents are hysterical. Definitely more for older teens
1,Love it
1,My kids loved it. Lots of laughter and enjoyment for the family. Even my toddlers loved it.

1,Love it
1,Awesome
1,Good production for fans of Connelly
1,Marvelous series!!
1,Great series. Love Benedict Comberbatch.
1,Great movie. Very touching.
1,Excellent
1,The ending was a bit transparent...but the message is still strong.
1,"This little film was a delightful surprise! As a hobby gardener who loves the English cottage garden look, I was inspired by the obvious love and dedication that produced all these gardens. Some videos of this sort are dull, but the short interviews with the English gardeners - all hobbyists like myself - made it so much more charming and entertaining. I thought it was just the right length, too: long enough to make you feel you really saw and appreciated each garden, but not so long that you ever get bored. Also, the choice of gardens was excellent. No repetition or sameness. Very well done!"
1,It's a classic that really introduced Richard Gere (every last inch of him) to fans.  Lauren Hutton and Gere have real chemistry in a twisted way.  It's well worth the watch with plenty of steam and intrigue. The resolution is a bit limited. I suspect this is due to film transfer and not having been digitally remastered.
1,"Marion Cotillard is a rare beauty who can act.  Also, Joaquin Phoenix can play someone on the edge better than any actor alive today."
1,The kids enjoyed it 
1,Nice to see that NASA is still politically correct.
1,freaking fantastic show. Everyone of us have had friends like these minus the fact that one of us could pay for everything for the rest.
1,its drags to much
1,Many plot twists!  Keeps you guessing
1,Entertaining
1,Love it
1,"It holds my interests, because it's so action packed. :-) There is always something new and interesting happening on the show."
1,pretty good series
1,The show improved over time.  The second season outshines the first.  The writing is much tighter.  The plot twist are more interesting.  I enjoyed every episode of season two.  So glad that Amazon picked them up.
1,One of my all time favorites.
1,"Fun, light movie on a quiet Sarurday night. No blood, profanity, and end of the world stuff."
1,"This is one of the best series I have ever seen. It's amazing to see Jeff Daniel's. His acting in a serious role is seriously good.  The show is well written and covers real issues in fictionalized stories. I highly recommend it. (However, I'm not sure political conservatives would like some episodes.)"
0,"What a poor representation of Christian ideologies. Not only is it a poorly written movie that bounces around too much, it also puts down other people's religions (case in point, the Muslim family in the movie with the abusive father). I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but now I understand why people think there's a &#34;Christian Agenda&#34; and why they are apprehensive when they find out I'm a Christian..."
1,Great!
1,Best movie I have ever watched
1,Loved it!  Awesome story of redemption!
1,Good show
1,Great sci-fi. I look forward to viewing each episode.each week.
1,"Very funny adult comedy. We all either know of somebody or have lived this situation in real life, which makes it all that much funnier."
1,I am a historian. This was excellent
1,We are enjoying the story lines but some of it is very graphic ðŸ˜
1,Lots of twists and turns.
1,Rate given by my three year old grand daughter.

1,A+
1,Love it!!!!
1,Jessica always a great performer!
1,I love the series everyone should watch it
1,"Off the chain with great episodes, acting, and drama. My number one television story."
1,Every now and then there comes an amazing cerebral movie that you cannot stop thinking about for days after watching it. Well done!
1,Love Veronica Mars
1,"It's ok. Just started watching, hopefully it will get better and it will explain why they are being attacked."
1,Was a good movie. Makes you think about your relationship with others.
1,Good bio-pic. It could use more music scenes.
1,Really well made series. I enjoy watching it while at work.
1,Good show. Excellent character development.
1,"Fantastic show with really interesting characters, wonderful writing.  The kind of show you cant stop watching and yet dont want to see the last episode.  Keep them coming!"
1,it would have been better if it was all english.
1,Great video.!!!!
1,"The series is great. Though what I did not like, for weeks I have been receiving e-mails that Season 3 was now also free for Amazon Prime customers. But when I log in, I am still being charged.<br />I ended up paying...but was not happy about it...."
1,Great series.
1,"Love this movie, Amazon just made it easy to watch!"
0,Not Will's best.
1,Watched 2 episodes.  I believe it will take 1 or 2 more to fully appreciate the series.
1,Great Movie ðŸŽ¥
1,Love this show don't want it to end
1,Kristen Wiig is now one of my favorite actors. Really authentic with a wide range. Great Movie overall. Bill Hader was great as well.
1,"Keep you watching movie, I like it"
1,This show is very engrossing and much more frantic than the previous seasons. If you can forgive the writers for presenting miscreant Democrats as wonderful citizens you can probably wade through it.
1,Loved! Couldn't stop watching!
0,"I enjoy all these actors (Jackson, Firth, and Caine) when they are given decent roles. This star cast was wasted in this disaster of a movie. Between the totally unbelievable plot to Samuel L. Jackson's lisp (did I really detect one???), the whole affair was too painful to watch. It was a poor man's James Bond and I turned it off well before the end. Give the talent here something to chew on for heaven's sake. From  The King's Speech  to this?  Aaaargh!"
1,"This movie was  great. It was so brave of Tom Hanks to do..  and yet I am not sure anyone else in Hollywood could have handled this part with the kind of stregnth and excellence.  I cannot stand Mary Steenburgen so she was perfectly cast for this .. the defense attorney it was easy to hate and dislike, And, in a perfect world this would not happen. Nice to see justice served"
1,This movie was crazy and didn't stop the thrill ride until the end. I wish the ending was a little better but overall it was pretty good.
1,love this show!
1,"Pretty cool show.  You never know who's gonna by the farm, they do a good job at keeping you guessing."
1,Sad to see it end!
1,"Good action flick.  Of course, you must be willing to &#34;suspend disbelief&#34; but I'm OK with that."
1,Awesome
1,My son love Danial and keeps watching him over and over.
1,"What a great way to kickoff season 2! Darth Vader, Ahsoka Tano, exciting action that moves the plot forward, it's great! Darth Vader is as menacing as ever.<br /><br />This show started slow IMO, but the three most recent episodes have been nothing short of magnificent and have officially hooked me into following this show to the end."
1,good entertaning movie but not the greatist acting
1,"This is a great movie, with a great hero.  A guy who was a 90-pound weakling with a 90-ton heart.  When the movie science changed him into a superhero, he kept the heart, along with his compassion and determination to rid the world of bullies.  A feel-good movie for the entire familyâ€”set in the WWII years."
1,Love all the Star Treks.
1,We love x files. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the odd content of the occasional episode. We like all the main characters. We usually have a hard time adjusting to new characters. But John Doggart and Monica Reyes have been great additions to the show.
0,"This series started off promising. I liked how the narrator discussed the location's history and didn't hype up the supernatural aspects, but halfway through the hoaxes were cheaper than a Halloween haunted hayride. Big disappointment."
0,I have never seen a more disjointed series of scenes passing itself as s movie and got only satisfied that the movie did not run s full hour and a half
1,Love Teen Wolf on Amazon Prime!
1,Great series.
1,I'm  addicted !!!
1,This was in excellent pilot good acting great.
1,"Great family flick! Fun, adventurous, and brings a classic to life."
1,So funny I really enjoy this show!
1,Can't wait for the next ; never know what's going to happen.
1,One of my all time favorite movies!
0,The acting is sub par. The plot is thin and obtuse at times. Obviously a low budget movie. Better off skipping it.
1,"Always wanted to watch this, so glad it's included with my Prime membership."
1,Was difficult to bear - but well done.
0,"Badly directed, camera work was beyond cheap--couldn't get past the first 20 minutes."
1,I was pleasantly surprised how much accompaning footage this documentary had.
1,Classic
1,It was a cute show. Didn't make my favorites but did enjoy.
1,Great movie.
1,"Normally, I do not view law enforcement shows. I enjoyed every single episode of Inspector Lewis!"
1,Awesome
1,Good SciFi but I got lost at times.
1,Interesting period drama giving a good overall picture of life in the early 1900's. Not particularly factual but nevertheless entertaining. Very well could have been a 5 star series as there is very good acting but there ate large &#34;peaks and valleys&#34; as far as the writing is concerned.
1,One of the best world war 2 series out there.
1,Seamless transition from BBC to Amazon. Very well done.
1,Terrific Series!  My husband & I enjoyed it very much.
1,Love this movie! Will watch over and over!
1,"Informative, great presenter, great visualizations."
1,Great series.
1,He's a great therapist some episodes and a lousy one on others. Entertaining.
1,My wife loves Erick
0,Not impressed...
1,WFB is one of the most powerful and clear thinkers of ANY time in U.S. history! Anyone who is a thinker must listen to this series!
0,Curse words throughout. Not exactly family friendly.
1,A bit &#34;dry&#34; documentary on the Falklands War where Great Britain transports troops and military hardware thousands of miles to re-take the Falkland Island from Argentina... I remember the actual events which were much more interesting to follow than this documentary portrays.  I gave it 3 stars.  Perhaps I should have given it 4.  But I was a bit bored with the report.
1,Great classic. Love the relationship between Oscar & Felix. Funny!
1,Great message!
1,"Funny, but not my style"
1,Great!  Ready for more episodes!!  Keep'em coming!
1,"Funny, thoughtful and very well acted. I was really sorry to see that this series did not last."
1,Keep episodes coming!
1,"I really liked and was entertained by this pilot. It was not dumbed down like many new shows seem to be. The writing, acting and production were well done. It seems to have potential."
1,Great flick ðŸ‘
1,A five star classic! Three stars for quality of the remake.  Watch the HD version.
1,Interesting but incredibly violent. One scene at a church is nearly unwatchable.
1,Great movie
1,"Pretty good movie. Better if you had watched the shows on HBO. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think it was just lacking something. What? Not really sure, but it left me feeling like I wanted more, maybe that was the plan?"
1,Good plot...fairly well acted.
1,"Outstanding performances, but very hard to watch. Very real and emotional."
1,Creative story line with twists and turns.  I enjoyed it a lot.
1,"Totally awesome! I don't watch much TV, but this one's got me hooked."
1,"This was outstanding!!  Bill Nighy is a great actor doing what he does with an exceptional cast.  Also, the script is so well done.  This is the intellectual's thriller, along with humor and subtlety.  The best!!"
1,"'ll make it short and sweet. This show is simply a masterpiece in every way. It's drama, suspense, action and comedy all rolled in to one and it's plot is so powerful that it will stay in your mind for years after you watch it. One episode moves seamlessly into another like pieces of a puzzle. Acting is second to none. The result is the show that other shows strive to live up to. It is rivaled only by an elite handful of other shows ever created. I can assure you that this will be one of the best, if not the best, TV series that ever graces your screen. That's all there is to it. If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor and check it out."
1,Great movie.  The really shy guy learns how to be out going and not be picked on.

1,"It's so nice to have good, well-done shows like this one available to watch."
1,"O M G--if your in to old movies--this is so great.Bette Davis gave her copy of the movie to the museum in Washington and they fixed some things,  It is really something."
1,"AWESOME,"
1,A good show.
1,I loved the way it ended with the Alpha dogs and Omega dogs loving each other.
1,Not what I thought is was going to be for the better.
0,Should have stopped after 8 seasons.  Lost the humor and became repetitive.
0,What an utter waste of my time!
1,Not very entertaining.
1,Not as good as I expected.<br />I'm a huge fan of the books [I've read each one at least twice] but it didn't translate to the screen as well as I expected.<br />My expectations may have been too high :(
1,"Bought it, watched it, enjoyed it. Would recommend at least for a rental to any fans who have yet to see it."
1,Obsessed with Louie CK and just had the chance to watch his show.  It doesn't disappoint.  His commentary and take on life is so spot on and hysterical.  Can't wait to watch it all.
1,"very enthusiastic, satirical and funny."
1,God TV series
1,riveting and perfectly written!
1,Can't wait for season 6
1,Interesting take on the old west... wondering if all the foul language was really spoken....<br />but other than that I like the story as my father's family in from the Black Hills. my father was born in Pringle<br />near the reservation and his father was an Indian agent on the  reservation... in the late 1890s through the 1920.
1,Very encouraging. It once again remind us that God loves us and &#34; makes all things (including hardships) work together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose&#34; Amen!!
0,"I think there were some funny parts in the movie, however overall it was only moderately funny. A very predictable B movie. Worth a watch on a night when nothing else is on but don't expect too much."
1,I thought it was a very cute movie and I watched it 3 times.
1,Can't wait for next 10 episodes 11/15
1,Great series!  Learned much about the history of New York and the many people and circumstances that have brought the city to these days.  The personalized approach of the series brought the times into our life in an extraordinary way.  We appreciated the detailed and compassionate handling of 9/11 and the first period after.  I hope that Ric Burns will do another episode on the developments post 9/11 from 2003 to present.<br /><br />Thank you!
0,Meh: The Good Wife is much better. I found it mediocre and didn't understand all the fuss.
1,Funny!  Glad these comedians are showing the real side of Muslims.
1,"Good movie, nothing beats the first movie though."
1,Show is Well put together
1,"excellent movie, well worth the money"

1,Awesome movie!!!
1,It's great and wonderful family movie

1,Love it
1,Eye opening and riveting. Should be required viewing for adults.
1,Excellent series
1,"A different take on awesome super heroes, but a good one! Certainly not a Kids movie, but a good animated comic movie for the older peeps nontheless."
1,My daughter loves this show!!
1,"It's a really great movie, even as an adult I liked watching it with my girls."
1,"NYPD Blue is a 10 plus show. Exciting, moving, plots. Extrodinary acting."
1,Love the characters and I think it's halarious! Can't wait to see more.
1,I don't laugh out loud often but this series focusing on Larry's reactions to what most of us encounter quite frequently in some form does induce this response in me all the time.
1,Not as good as season 1 and 2. The story gets a little out there but comes around by end of season
0,I only watched a few minutes and shut it off!
1,Good Show
1,Great delivery by Jeremy Irons!
1,COOL GROOVY AND FAROUT
1,"The wife and I have been working backward, starting with Season 13 and descending.  By the time we got to 11, we might have been a bit over saturated with Zak's deuchiness ... he really is a self-centered tard.  However, he does (in his defense) attempt to take a realistic look at the spiritual, the team attempts to debunk findings instead of just assuming everything is caused by ghosts, and that says something.  They're good entertainment."
1,Left me wanting to see the next episode.
1,Interesting series. That good guy is really a bad guy and visa versa. I had fun watching the series and will continue to watch with season 2
0,Why am I still watching this? :)<br />It no longer has anything to do with the original Stephen King story.<br />And it just keeps getting stupider.<br /><br />The only enjoyable character (for me) is Dean Norris as Big Jim.
0,It had it's moments...just missed being okay
1,A great movie
0,Terrible movie
1,Good entertainment!
0,Quality of film lousy
1,"Always knew about the show, but never had time to watch it. funny"
1,"I really enjoyed this program. It really enlightened me to be careful when talking to someone on the internet. Personally, I never do but so many people fall in this trap. I was surprised as to the number of people were either &#34;Catfishing&#34; someone or visa versa.Some of the people who were caught had no remorse for devastating a person`s life. For your own protection, people should watch this show."
1,Great movie...
1,"FINAL DESTINATION is a color movie taking place in the present era.  The plot concerns a group of high school students taking an overseas field trip to France.  The high school students are accompanied by two adult teachers.  During the first half hour, the students gather in an airplane terminal and board the plane.  Then, one of the students takes a nap and has a dream where a latch handle falls of from the flip-down table at his seat, where the plane then starts shaking, where oxygen masks all are released into the passenger compartment, where a fire starts inside the cabin, where a chunk of the wall blows out and a passenger is sucked out of her seat into the atmosphere, and where the plane crashes.  Then, the student wakes up from his awful dream, and tugs on the latch handle, and it falls off just like in his dream.  Then, the student realizes that this is a harbinger of the airplane crash.  At this point, the plane has not yet taken off.  The student (Devon Sawa) raises and alarm and rushes out of the airplane, and a handful of the other students join him and leave the airplane.  The group of students watch the airplane take off from the runway, and they are shocked when they see the airplane blow up in mid-air.  The remaining hour of the movie concerns the notion that the fate of each of the surviving students is somehow predetermined, and that each of the surviving students will soon die.  Two agents from the FBI spend this remaining  hour tailing the student.  The actors playing the FBI agents are very good, and this aspect of the plot adds a further dimension of suspense to the plot.<br /><br />Much of the movie concerns the role of fate in killing off the surviving students and the surviving teacher.  Because of the somewhat repetitive aspects of this portion of the plot, it might be reasonable to characterize FINAL DESTINATION as a &#34;B movie.&#34;  But it is a good movie, and it provides food for thought regarding the concept of pre-destination.  Theending of this movie is not really a distinct one.  The plot just sort of withers away suddenly.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS.  The special effects are excellent.  The tilting and shaking of the airplane, as depicted in the student's dream, is excellent.  The fire and explosion where a chunk of the wall is blown out, is very realistic looking.  After the airplane sequence, much of the rest of the movie shows electric sparks, tumbling kitchen knives the plunge into a schoolteacher's chest, and fires caused by spilled alcoholic beverages.  These are all realistic.<br /><br />TWENTY TWO.  The closest story that I know to FINAL DESTINATION is a Twilight Zone episode called, Twenty Two.  Twenty Two stars Barbara Nichols, who is a nightclub dancer experiencing mental exhaustion.  She is in a hospital receiving care for her exhaustion, when one of the hospital employees (Arlene Martel) who works in the hospital's morgue says to Barbara Nichols, &#34;Room for one more, honey.&#34;  Arlene Martel (who is more like a spirit than a real person) also provides a warning to Barbara Nichols, right before boarding an airplane.  Barbara Nichols decides to return to the terminal, and from the terminal she sees the airplane blowing up.  Hence, in my opinion, watching Twenty Two will enhance your enjoyment and appreciation of FINAL DESTINATION.  Another Twilight Zone episode should also be mentioned.  This is PRIVATE CHANNEL from the color Twilight Zone episodes, from 1986-1987.  PRIVATE CHANNEL is just as excellent as TWENTY TWO, but since it is of more recent cinematographic vintage, it is the case the the acting in PRIVATE CHANNEL has much more pizzazz.  Scott Coffey plays the starring role, as man about 18 to 22 years old, who acquires a premonition that his airplane will crash.  Scott Coffey ends up saving all the passengers of a jet plane (including himself) from a bomb.  To repeat, both of these Twilight Zone episodes have a plot similar to that in FINAL DESTINATION, and will likely enhance your enjoyment of FINAL DESTINATION."
1,You never have to worry about letting your kids or grandkids watch Mr. Rogers.  I miss him.
0,Horrible movie
1,amazing amazing amazing.  I cant stop watching.  I started watching the series just a couple months ago and can't believe I wasn't watching this show from day 1.  outsanding writing and acting.  Best show in long long time.
1,"Season 2 flows better than season 1, not as much &#34;how are we going to die today&#34; and more mission/exploration oriented. Universe had a lot of promise, which knocked it up 1 star for me."
1,"Love Voyager and its crew. Janeway reminds me so much of Captain Kirk, the same idealist who while quoting the Federation's policies breaks them just this time.  The series is winding down, but seven years of 24 episodes per season demonstrates just how good television was."
1,Freakin love this show
1,Excellent story line.  All hail Optimus Prime!!!
1,Glad for another Season to watch.  Good quality
1,Love it. Entertaining and funny.
1,"This is a thoughtful movie that is able to switch back and forth quickly from home and family relationship and war-fighting and the soul searching associated with both activities.  It seems to get a little preachy, especially at the end, concerning CIA ethics (or lack thereof).  Ethan Hawke did a great job making me believe he was grizzled savvy vet pilot."
1,It's a good show.
1,seems like only 1/2 of the story was told...
1,Great history of the castle used on Downton Abbey.
1,Awesome
1,I love this show!
0,"Season 1 was great, season 2 was ok, but at this point I am only sticking around to find out the meaning of the dome itself. What attracted me to this show was the breakdown and rebuilding of a society during a disaster, and the possible supernatural tie-in. Season 2, I forgave, because most sophomore seasons are exposition-laden, wobbly and never really as good as the first. Season 3... Well, this season was very painful to watch. The dialogue was predictable and uninspired (Dean Norris, you have been robbed!), and the plot is super messy. It's as if the point of this season was to render all of season 2 moot, by essentially getting rid of characters and story lines that were prominent in it (what was the point of the Melanie character at all? Or Junior's Mom and that damn red door?) and using a warped-time line to force the plot into some other crazy direction.<br /><br />It seems the &#34;in thing&#34; to kill off main characters in shows these days, which is something I applaud: in my belief, the story should come first, not the actors' contracts or network's pocketbooks. But there are 3 deaths in the first two episodes that just didn't even need to happen. The story didn't move forward, or anywhere, because of those deaths. And, as a woman, I am against woman-shaming, but Marg Helgnberger's lips need some serious fixing. That's all I can think about in her scenes, and she has so very many scenes! SPOILER ALERT: I am only sticking around because I heard the dome comes down this season. With one episode left, it better!  I don't think I'll be back to watch this next year. Stephen King, you've disappointed me here, but I will buy the book. It has to be a million times better than the show!<br /><br />9/8/15 Update: yay! They are putting this show out of it's misery!"
1,"So far, this gets a 5 star rating in my book. I love how we get to see how it all went down those few weeks that Rick was in the coma. The character development is there, and yes, it starts off slow, but I would expect nothing less. We are seeing the collapse of society and what happens in the weeks leading up to Rick waking up from a coma. The internet, power, cell towers ect are all starting to be internment, and you can't help but wonder when that fails completely. I, for one, can't wait to see what happens to our characters. This is a brilliant spin off, and I hope we get a few season out of this. It will be nice to see a different side to the end of the world."
1,great
1,"Barbara Steeleâ€¦what more can you sayâ€¦the horror film icon of the 1950's returns to the big screenâ€¦this one has a fairly complicated series of interwoven sub-plots, so pay attention early to who the characters areâ€¦love seeing my favorites still at it..."
1,Very good exciting movie.
0,Couldn't get through it.  My husband and I watched for 15 minutes or so and just couldn't get into it.
1,I enjoyed this movie especially being at home and bored.I can not say I  would tell all my friends to watch it.It was just right for that moment.

1,Love this series and I think excellent choices were made in casting...especially Four  =^..^=
0,I DID NOT LIKE THIS ONE.
1,"I like documentaries, this movie shows what the Germans did right and wrong using their armour."
1,This is mandatory viewing. No exceptions.
1,I like the twists in the storyline.
1,"Quick Review: This is a top notch production. The apocalyptic story, script and acting is superb. The pretty Haley Lu Richardson is outstanding as the main character. So much is learned on survival through this movie."
1,The whole family loved this movie!!
1,My five and seven year olds love this show. Entertaining and educational
1,I love these actors!
1,Enjoying the series-great acting.  I would have preferred something a little less arrogant and one sided in perspective. I feel like it is intentionally rewriting history.
1,100 stars...per my son
1,This was a great movie.
1,It shows the rise to power of Nero though there are historical inaccuracies with the plot and they do not show the true relationship between Nero and his mother Agrippina. Decent sword and sandals movie though there was no fighting involved so it was lacking in many regards. It does give an interesting plot and story angle to Nero
0,Storyline wasn't that great. A little boring. Probably better left as the book version
1,I love
1,Pretty darn good. worth the rental
1,Great music
0,"A little slow, but maybe intended to be. Sets a tone."
1,Season 5 and season 4 are the two best seasons.  Enjoying this series a lot.
1,Best family show ever made!!  It deals with real life issues that families deal with on a daily bases. I think children and parents alike can relate and learn from this show.
1,"it was okay, but not a movie I would watch twice."
1,"Makes you think how infidelity can change your life in a heartbeat!  I usually like more action type movies but this sucked me in, to want to see the ending which was understood considering his past."
1,Sweet sweet story. Loved it and will recommend to others.
1,Liked it as much as the first one.
1,A fantastic  movie!!  Fun & Smart!
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
1,A classic Newman and Redford pairing.  Lost count of how many times over the years I have watched this movie.
1,2 year old Daughter is obsessed.
1,Charming characters in a cute story.
1,I love this show wish it were given a prime season
1,Great Movie. Let's you know that God has their Back.
1,My only wish is that there were more seasons.
1,Great show.  Must watch.
1,Very informative story about our national heroes. God bless them and their families.
1,"Kind of banal at first,  but it actually surprised me."
0,The concept of the story draws in the viewer but the content itself is unnecessarily mundane with complicated sub-plots that take away from the original premise.<br /><br />I hope Season 2 steps it up.
0,"What a mess Season 3 was. The weekly intro was never changed, saying &#34;3 weeks ago a dome..&#34; I think once I heard they added a week. So this all happened in a few days?<br />Terrible overacting and Marge Helgenberg, what a come down from CSI. Stupid egg, glowing purple quartz, cocoons. How the actors could utter such poorly written dialogue without laughing is beyond me. Poor kid falls off roof and is paralyzed and next day is fine tho paralyzed in a wheelchair.<br />Did Steven King really write this? I watched just to see how much more ridiculous it got."
0,Don't waste your time!!
1,"I would have rather seen a miniseries with much more detail.  In other words, I'm interested - tell me more.  Ashton Kutcher did a great job."
1,"For years, I've heard how amazing Wall-E is.  As a huge fan of the original Toy Story, I finally gave it a shot.  Beautiful visuals, and fun storytelling based on the lack of robot dialogue.  But just a *tiny* touch cliche.  So is it close to my heart like TS?  No.  But I respect the craftsmanship that went into this one."
1,Hilarious! If you like this I also suggest &#34;Flight of the Concords&#34;
1,Fun movie. I will watch it again
0,"An absolutely horrendous movie that was anchored in truly bad writing and direction.  There were spots of decent acting, but even that couldn't save this one.  Not sure what Crowe was thinking, but he certainly didn't put his best effort into this one."
1,I really like this piece.  It had an old-timey feel to it.  It had a great plot and good suspense.
1,Clever and different!
1,Great!
1,"Awesome writing, great acting, mature audiences only!!"
1,loved it when is the next episode?
1,"Somewhat entertaining, typical, post apocalyptic earth story... except that the main protagonist is a very believable young lady who is both kick-ass and at times vulnerable and very human.  Some parts were a little hokey, and the &#34;monsters&#34; could have been a bit more realistic, but overall, I truly enjoyed the ride.<br />P.S.  I always enjoy Kevin Sorbo"
1,Loved by our three year old grand daughter.
0,"I was hoping to be disturbing, sick, twisted etc ... boring"
1,Love this show!!!
1,Great
1,"Intelligently written, superbly acted.  I was VERY sad when I watched the last episode.  This show rates right up there with The West Wing, one of the best television dramas of all time."
1,My girls love this show.  They can watch it over and over and over.
1,great
1,"Very entertaining with terrific actors, I'm looking forward to a full season."
1,Great series.  We try to only view one episode at a time but seldom keep from viewing two or more.
1,loved it
1,Pretty much mindless entertainment when you need it. Good family stories of the bayou!
1,"Season 2 is better than season 1. We hung on through season 1, and now with all the character development, it's becoming more interesting to watch."
1,"Great, great war movie, I loved it"
1,Great family movie my two boys love watching this one. My three year old little boy says the little girl is cute lol!
1,"Love, Love, LOVE!"
1,"All star cast... A bit hoakie at times, but if you can love a movie and get into it for the entertainment this movie was awesome"
1,"Smart, funny, entertaining. Draws you in and then you're hooked."
1,Just that. Not much else to say.
1,My 2yr old daughter loves it!
1,Great series
1,"Aiden Turner is dreamy as the lead character, Ross Poldark.  His eventual wife Dimelza gives a perfect companion performance.  There's a whole cast of interesting, unforgettable characters.  Put this on your Must See List!"
0,couldn't maintain interest in characters
1,"Classic in every sense of the word.  I expected it to feel dated but it did not in the least.  All performances are spot on, and I got a strong flashback to my three years in law school, especially that critical first year."
1,My grandkids have watched 3 times already.
1,awesome I love that movie
1,love it!
1,Love it! I wish I'd watched it when it was on TV.
1,"I read the 50 Shades trilogy a few years ago when EVERYONE was talking about it and was not at all impressed. The writing was poor and some of the lines were very cheesy. The idea was interesting though, and I felt there was a story there, just not well told. I was among a long line of girlfriends that decided to go out and watch 50 Shades when it came out in theater to see how Hollywood had adapted the story on screen. I was actually very impressed! My husband didn't like the movie AT ALL and couldn't understand why any female would be interested in being abused. I think that is what made me like the movie though. It really did a good job of showing the main characters being torn between several conflicting ideas of right and wrong, desire, sex, and control. They were vulnerable. Also, Hollywood didn't downplay the issue of BDSM going too far and what it does to someone not ready to be submissive. Lastly, I liked that the movie had a lot of comic relief. The story needing to be told could get very awkward and very heavy and the author made the characters come to life well."
1,This movie is well worth watching. It starts out kind of slow but then really picks up and becomes a fast paced action movie.
1,Mind blowing the way it shakes you when see the flag
1,"My wife and I weren't sure that we were going to like it in the beginning, but it kept getting better and better as we got further into it, and were very glad that we stayed with it. In fact,we told our daughters and their families about it, and they plan to watch it too."
1,"This is a great movie. A bit slow in areas, but overall, a very enjoyable and entertaining flick."
1,Love the series.  Great characters and story lines.
1,A good revenge movie. Could almost see Burl Ives as &#34;Daddy&#34;.
1,Love this series.
1,"Great cast, action flick!"
1,"I really liked this, will watch it again."
1,Great movie.  Full of laughs!
1,Entertaining movie that has become a classic for my children.
1,"I Gave this one three out of four stars because it was a poor attempt to remake the original. The story line followed the original marginally if you think about it.<br />Lets take and nit pick a few things.<br />First the alien ship. In the original John Carpenter movie, they used the Footage from the original 1950â€™s version where they uncover the ship using explosives. The ship was out side when they found it uncovered with thermite if I remember correctly. This version has them finding it in an ice cave. Albeit that might be a bit more realistic considering enough explosives to uncover a ship of that size would have taken up a lot more space on the ice. But simply put, they changed that part. Lets not forget that the fact is that they were using computer graphics in this movie that werenâ€™t available to the people during the time period. Creative licensing is ok, but if this is the prequel to the first movie, continuity please. Then there is the poor explanations for the various deaths that Kirk Douglasâ€™s character found when he and the doctor for the original movie showed up. To easy.<br />It was a good movie effects wise, but to those of us out there that really enjoyed the original when we were kids. It lacked. If you havenâ€™t seen the original yet. See this first, and understand that the original was made in the 1970â€™s. Otherwise you might be disappointed by the follow up."
1,Still one of the best shows on TV
1,This is truly a classic movie !
1,Addictive
1,Good series

1,Not as well done as the earlier seasons.
1,Oldy but qoody.
1,need the next season
1,loved it.  the season finale left me on the edge of my seat.  could not wait to start season 3.
1,Good movie with a surprise ending
1,How can you not love &#34;The Wrong Pants?&#34;<br /><br />They are all great.
1,"I'm not sure anything was highly original in this series. In fact, it seems to have taken several sci fi chestnuts and whipped them into a familiar tasting but still palatable dish. The lovable robots, the evil robots, the aliens driven by desperation to colonize Earth, the astronaut who brings back an interstellar virus, the broke-down-but-heart-of-gold combat vet, the evil mega-corporation with the shadowy infrastructure: all our favorites! Familiarity is not necessarily a bad thing, especially when good acting and a little tweaking of dialogue and plot make the familiar fun. Great escape series, for my money."
0,THAT is all
0,"Shallow, cruel, aggressively trying to tie itself to the jargon of Gen Z. I feel stupider for having watched this piece of garbage."
1,Major improvement in writing since last year.
0,Was very sub par.

1,Liked this one a lot better than the other one. BBC dominates Jane Austen!
1,"Excellent mini series. Good casting, wonderful script.  So glad there's more than one season."
1,A team full of superheroes combine their powers to save the world from bad people around the universe. Facing a artificial intelligence robot that tries to destroy the world and kill all humanity. New people joining the team to add extra power and more people to fight the enemies.  Turning the members of the team against each other was one of the ideas that the enemy used to fight The Avengers. Although the world almost got destroyed but the team made it to save the day again. The acting was great with the special effects. Everything worked together in a great way to make a wonderful film that made many people around the world like it. Also the acting of the people made the film work great. Picking Scarlett Johansson to do black widow worked great to the film. Her acting was good the moves and some of the scene she did were great. On the other hand picking Mark Ruffalo to do the Hulk wasnâ€™t the smartest thing for me. I donâ€™t think that doing Hulk is good for him because I see him as a calm person not a person with anger management problems. He always seems calm to me. The trailer locked great by showing some of the best scenes of the movie. This film collected around 1.4bil $ this year from all around the world. By having a lot of good reviews many people think that this film is one of the best films this year.
1,Interesting premise (not sure whether or not it is historically accurate).  Beautiful costumes and the acting is outstanding.
0,I expected this movie to be a comedy but it was not funny.
1,Awesome
1,"Fantastic episode, gripping from the first scene., I was totally surprised by the ending. Wow!"
1,Good watch all around! They bring down his power a lot though. Still entertaining.
1,it was interesting but not my favorit
1,"This is really good. I did not think it would be. It keeps you on your toes. You can feel what they feel some of the time. Keeps you guessing also. Enjoy, I did."
1,Great old film.
1,Good
1,Not Bad - fairly erotic.
1,I'd like to see more!
1,This was a feel good movie - I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.  It had a typical story line with a good ending.  Enjoy!
1,Love this show!
1,Gritty true to life.
1,Good history but had sad parts.
1,Fun and serious at the same time in following a certain age group despite cultural differences . Speech accents were not easy to understand in some segments. All in all it was entertaining and interesting.
1,"Storyline is awesome, but the video was choppy and continually stalled."
1,Hooked.
1,Definitely a man's show. It's got everything an adrenaline junky wants in a TV show!
1,Mine daughter loved this movie
1,Entertaining
1,Leg on the table!!!!!!!
1,Just love b westerns
0,"Kind of cheesy. Didn't hold my interest. Love sci fi, fantasy & action but the poor acting and low budget special effects just didn't fit the bill for me."
1,Good
1,"Being based on a true story, I wish there would have been some notes at the end indicating the outcome of the people involved. Good flick!!"
1,"Elephants are wonderful animals!  Humans at times are not!  This is clearly a movie in favor of elephants, which is appropriate for the treatment they have received at the hands of people.  A second video or extension of the first would be to show how other US zoos are coming around to the needs of elephants and more of the safe zones for those captured from circuses."
1,Excellent movie
1,Awesome. !!!!!!
1,Great movie
1,One of the greatest TV series ever produced.
1,I always loved the original. I have to say that I was impressed with this version. I would watch it again.

1,"By FAR my favorite series!!!  Funny to actually root for the bad guys.  It has everything you need in a series, and it lasts all the way through."
0,"I love Jack Black, but this was the saddest thing I've seen. I decided to watch as my teenage son had me listen to a song on you tube by them from 2010. Loved it, so decided to watch.....um yeah. Maybe they're like fine wine and got better with time, but I couldn't even get through the first episode. Disappointed."

1,I need not say anything new. It's out there - One of the best romantic comedies of all time.
1,"Not sure why but, I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did the others. It's still a good movie just, not as good as the others."
1,No comment
1,"Irreverent, funny, interesting and playful all describe the macho friendship oriented Entourage. Great show."

1,Classic horror film from the 80's!  I love it!
1,Off to a slow start but okay overall
1,"An engaging story, whimsically and well told."
1,Fun show with great casting and writing.
1,Worth the time if you don't take it too seriously.
1,"I don't know what people are complaining about this movie is awesome. All of the characters are given a good amount of focus even with the new characters that are introduced. I love the team chemistry the Avengers have with each other they play off each other in battle real well. The Hulkbuster vs Hulk fight was badass Tony stark manages to go toe to toe with the green rage monster and put up a damn good fight.<br /><br />I love the focus and development on Hawkeye they did seem to be setting him up to die by giving him a family and promising to make it home, but in the end I'm glad they did'nt do that he's one of my favorite marvel heroes. Everything in the farmhouse is great character building for the Avengers. They do set up future plots for the mcu but those never felt intrusive to me I think there was only like 4 scenes in the movie that did that and they were usually pretty quick. The relationship with Black widow and Hulk was a pretty nice one to see, and it makes sence their relationship started when Black widow went to get him and since then they've had alot of interaction to build some nice chemistry.<br /><br />Captain America and Iron man you can tell friction is building in this movie. Their ideals clash even harder than they did in the last movie and it eventually leads to a brief fight between them, it was a nice little preview for what we'll see in Civil War the tension was high but once Vision was created everything came into prospective again. The climax of the move was just epic, Hawkeye being the one to finally convince the other two to become Avengers with that awesome yet hillariouis speech was just great. Despite the earlier tension the team puts that aside to finish the job.<br /><br />All in All this movie was just as epic as the first Avengers and it's a damn shame some people can't seem to see that."
1,Loved the drama and twists.
1,I never tire of Ed Burns and Public Morals is no exception!
1,good
1,Excellent!
1,This series is addictive!!!  It's entertaining while being educational at the same time.  The characters are compelling and the story is fascinating.  I love Maggie Smirh's character's humor most of all.  Superior programming.
1,very good
1,Great show with excellent moral teachings
1,It's currently our favorite show. Ongoing story line keeps us wanting to find out what happens next. Good show..
1,House Party was the best of bunch and truly captured the black teens of my generation.
1,"Hilarious Movie with Ma and Pa Kettle as the neighbors of the Newlywed couple trying to make a start of Chicken farming. Classic comedy , highly recommended for all who enjoy the classic film era!"
1,Love this series!  Can't wait for Season Two!
1,"Funniest damn thing we've watched in ages.  It's irreverent and edgy.  The 30 minute time frame is just right for binge-watching, which is what you'll want to do.  This is Denis Leary at his best: writing, directing, producing and acting. Get ready to laugh till you're stomach hurts!"
1,Superb
1,Our 4 yr old daughter loves this show. I love it for the science!
0,Horrible
1,"Let me start by saying, throwing in Marg Helgenberger was a HUGE mistake. She doesn't fit the rest of the cast and has been the center of the frustration this third season has brought.<br />The story line has dwindled as well but that's overlooked by the under-climactic scenes. I mean we've been waiting to see that baby born for what seems like forever now and episode 10 just put out the dwindling fire. It started with the mildly boring acting and finished with upsetting one liners.... And Seriously, Jr WALKS out of the house in front of half a dozen armed aktaion employes, they seriously watch him leave?!?! I mean I've seen bad writing but this is just pitiful. And the whole &#34;is he kinship, is he not&#34; is such a sad excuse for some added drama. Newsflash... They're under a freaking DOME! Tell the writers to get with it already. Good on these actors for still working and putting forth their best effort to save a desperately failing tv show.<br />All in all it is still entertaining because I've watched since season 1. But I will not be watching a 4th season if there is one.<br />Aaaaaaaannd , I bet they're regretting killing off all the good characters in the first season."
1,Glee has been a nice young teen family show to watch in the evenings for my family.
0,"Poor acting, poor special effects, poor cinematography, poor plot line. It's like bad CGI from 1990. I watched it only because my pre-teen son and I were having a great time picking it apart. For instance, look for the blue Chevy pickup as a background vehicle in 2 or three scenes AFTER it's been destroyed by the monster. Modern-day street signs in a movie set in the late 50s. Oh, and the scene in the cave when the two guys are splashed with chemicals and their faces melted off? Hilarious, especially when they take turns screaming. &#34;Aaargh!&#34; &#34;Aaaaargh!&#34; &#34;Aaaaargh!&#34;"
1,"Holds my attention, thought-provoking in that sci-fi way. I enjoy watching, but find it frustrating and not believable when characters shift allegiances or intentions as quickly as they do in this show."
1,Each episode is funnier then the first one.  Great for all the family.
1,good for the younger people about the world  war 2 history
1,great fun
1,Loved this show.
1,"A great show, and very family friendly. The humor really is clean and GREAT!"
1,Good story! Hard time following time line.
1,great
1,Good stuffs.
0,Acting was awful.  Couldn't make through more than 20 mins.
1,I first watched this movie 3 years ago as part of a reward for everyone getting good grades in class. I never forgot it. This movie is so creative. It just feels like one of those favorites you have to have on your movie shelf
0,Very slow and no real resolution n
0,Waste of good film.
1,"I really liked it.  Good character development and basically, a good story.  On the downside, it was very dark and there seemed to be more complexity than was really necessary.  Now, I don't mind dark, in fact, for the most part I really like any story that addresses a dark subject in a manner that is serious and not &#34;Hollywood&#34; cartoonish.  That being said, I found myself wanting to go back to the earlier scenes to determine what I might have missed.  If it had not been for the (in my opinion) undue complexity, I'd have given it five stars."
1,cant waiitt for epi 2!
1,Great season. Great group.
0,"2-stars is the fairest rating.  Manu is a coati.  I thought it was a type of monkey, but it's a relative of the raccoon that lives in Central & South America.  He by his nature gets into trouble and gets exiled.  Sacha, also a coati, is his friend/sorta girlfriend and also princess of the tribe.  She goes looking for Manu and is captured by poachers.  The story goes on from there and has a moral of accepting others as they are.<br /><br />Pro's:  Eh, It wasn't horrible.<br /><br />Cons:  The cheap looking animation style.<br />  The really simplistic dialog of the script."
1,Make sure you start on a weekend because you won't be able to stop!
1,So so
1,"Good combat footage,"
1,"Interesting premise, liked it"
1,"Watching this series brings a new perspective to the Ferguson and Baltimore riots. The violence, language, explicit sex are difficult to watch, but they are also what makes the series feel real. The series is well written and informative. The occasional humorous moments in the script are much appreciated. They provide a chance for you to catch your breath."
1,Good series
1,"Great waste of time with mindless and shallow humor - definitely not an intellectual flick but when looking to unwind and just laugh out loud, this movie faithfully delivers.<br />It's all in the reflexes."
1,I love watching a competitive  race that is true in nature and filled with twists keeping you enthralled in the adventure. Great reality  show .
1,Its a great series
1,Interesting! I do wonder how much is factual and what is &#34;hollywood&#34;.
1,I love garfeild it's a classic
1,I am impressed with the story line and love the constant plot changes.
1,Excellent as good as the movie
1,Very entertaining.
1,My wife and Daughter enjoyed the movie.
1,Wonderful story of a beloved character's life!
1,HILARIOUS!!
1,Love this show! Funny and entertaining. Curse words are bleeped out and can watch it with my 15 yr old
1,"If you like dark humor, this is a well-acted and loaded with talent film. Quirky, interesting, and definitely off the beaten path sort of film . Colin Farrell has shown us his talent in In Bruges and anytime you see Christopher Walken in a movie, you know he has chosen a juicy role.<br /><br />Great storyline, great cast, good direction, an unexpected delight for those that love dark humor and don't mind a lot of fake gruesome stuff (it's fake enough to be tolerable)"
1,"Wholesome, funny, timeless. Reminds of a time when civility was normal and admired"
1,"Very well acted, entertaining and thought provoking"
1,Great story line
0,I wanted to go into some depth but I can't devote anymore of my life to this movie. It was unwatchable.
1,I hope there is more coming...
1,"Solid site, although somewhat predictable."
1,Great movie
1,Good flick
1,"I didn't watch this-but Mike Harding has. He gives it 5 stars, and says it's creepy that Amazon is paying attention to what he watches ;)"
1,Really enjoyed..and I don't like westerns
1,"Absolutely one of the best shows!! Looking forward to.seeing Season 6. The storylines are great and I love how the family interacts with one another and has Sunday dinner with one another no matter what. There should be more shows like this. Love each and every family member. The cast of characters couldn't be any better. Love, love, love this show!!"
0,"Fun for an over the top action movie. The story felt like 3 different movies in one. It starts out a Resident Evil clone, then takes a left turn and becomes a medieval times movie, then for no reason, gets a Bentley and has a Mad Max car chase to finish it.<br />Enjoyable on a Sunday afternoon if you're not looking good much."
1,"Great plot, superb acting"
1,Thoroughly enjoyed all 12 seasons of NYPD Blue. Wished it could have continued!
1,Great movie. Its one of those movies that never seems to get old or dated. Great story and great acting.
1,Good original drama
1,"Good Movie for free.  A little slow in the beginning, good ending."
1,Well done.
1,"Fast paced, complex story of an LAPD detective that stays in hot water. Good times!"
1,Great early adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY. It has the beautiful cinematography of Minghella's later adaptation and the much more beautiful Alain Delon as the psychopathic Tom Ripley.
1,I came to this series only a couple of years before the finale. I loved this series from the first time I sW it and even got my hisband hooked on it. I found the story lines interesting and the character interaction spellbinding. I didn't want to but I liked Boyd and found myself rooting for the &#34;bad guy&#34;. Well done. Sorry it's over.
1,"My daughter watches this on repeat! If your child loved the movie, he/she will be sure to love this mini-movie! I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't that impressed with the way it looked on my tv. It just looked....off. But my 3 year old doesn't seem to care on bit!"
1,"A great, thoughtful show with strong characters.  I love the actress who plays the Producer...she is tough, sweet, gentle and she is a pleasure to watch.  There is no bitchiness about her, just real, calm, funny.  She commands respect, but doesn't have to be a jerk to get it.  Thanks for making a series filled with people that are easy to relate to.  It is wonderful to watch after a tough day at work.  I work in a high stress environment and I don't need to watch anything to add to that."
1,Very interesting. Personally I agree. In their position I would grow poppy plants as well. If people in the West are dumb enough to choose to use drugs I see nothing wrong in profiting from their stupidity. It happens even with many legal products that people buy even when they do them harm at the worst or of no benefit at best. Tobacco for one thing. A person can plant tobacco and it is legal and hey if people are dumb enough to smoke. Or heck there are a lot of just plain dumb stuff out their that become fads and we buy them like crazy and look back later and wonder what the Hell we were thinking. So yeah I see nothing wrong in profiting on people's just plain stupidity
1,Good show
1,"Beautifully written, suspenseful, and sexy. A wonderful work of television!"
1,"I was mesmerized by the opening segment. The movie seemed a bit slow and by the 2nd Chapter, I was too invested to stop watching.  Then, the movie started coming together for me and by the end, I was captivated.  I have seen it twice now that I know what to look for and I have recommended it to my friends."
1,Entertaining for 11 yr old
1,"I've always enjoyed Star Trek. I guess I'm a geek, but they make great sci fi movies. They've continued to make great strides in the special effects category to make these. The stories are great as well."
1,"Very educational my 3.5 year old love it, I recommend it."
1,Only a couple of episodes in to the season and I think it will be the best yet!
1,Such a good show!
0,"Pretty much every one of the cast members is painful to watch this season, but for different reasons: Shannon, because her marriage is disintegrating and she's in complete denial; Meghan because she's not the sharpest tool in the shed, and her awkward pauses during conversations where she's desperately searching for a word are distracting; Heather because her new house is obnoxious, Tamra because she's still on the show.. it's clear she's even getting on her husband's last  nerve, and they've only been married 2 years. I would have never thought that Vicky would be the most watchable or sane person on here, but it's been 10 seasons so I guess it was her turn. Probably not the best choice to film the actual moment she learned of her mother's death though.<br /><br />It might be time for the OC to go back behind the gates. Would like to see it replaced with a Real Housewives of Silicon Valley. Hope someone from Bravo is reading... Same level of wealth and perhaps a smarter cast."
1,Very addictive show.  Jon Voight is great!
1,"I'd watch this again right now, just after washing it. It was very interesting, and the plot line kept you thinking. There were parts that caught you off guard, and parts that made you cringe a little. I'd recommend to a friend."
1,"OK, it's a soap opera -- but it is still gripping!  Most of the characters are complex, and every time I find a hole in the plot, an answer is provided.  This series is addictive!"
1,"I REALLY LIKED IT.  I don't know if it was realistic or not (it seemed so), but it had lots of action,  Which I like!"
1,Great!
0,This is a movie about some Millenials who have nothing going on.  It would have been better if they both did themselves in in the first of the movie and then I would not have wasted my time.  How do I get those hours back wasted watching this anguish of a film without an ending?
1,Gripping
1,ok
1,Average too many remakes of the Kahn story.
1,need more seasons
1,Love be this show hoping for more!!!
1,Great movie and story
1,Watching the first show I wasn't sure if I would like it but got caught up in the story line and the characters became more interesting as it went along.  Now I'm looking forward to the next season.
1,Interesting!
1,This show can be watched again and again.  It will make you laugh each time.
0,So far this is the worst season. Two stars because not all of it was bad there were a handful of good episodes. Looks like writers are running out of material.
1,Grandkids love it!!
1,"Newsroom is well produced and written. I wasn't bored with any of the episodes, and I looked forward for the next one. It wasn't filled with sex and bad language, which I wouldn't watch, although there is some.<br />I wouldn't advise letting a teenager view it, but I wouldn't be embarrassed if I were watching it with  adult.<br />Worth watching and I'm ready for the next season."
1,Love it!
1,Can't wait for season 2!!!!!
1,Don't need to see the love seens so explicit...men and men and all...........rather let my brain figure it out
1,"What a wonderful story about love, faith, and courage.  Very uplifting though sad."
1,Grab the tissues
1,Very good!
1,Best show ever
1,Love it since I was a kid big fan ðŸ˜
1,Fascinating look into a people group that lives day-by-day in some of the world's harshest weather.
0,I love humor but this is way too filthy for anyone. It's sad too because it doesn't need all of that crap to be entertaining
1,"Very well done; however, I'm not a big horse person so I'm afraid the glory of this movie was a bit lost on me. Only watched about half so you really should look at other reviews."
1,A very inspirational movie. The acting was great and it was exciting as well.
1,vry well done and heartfelt stories
1,Great funny movie that o watch with your family.
1,"Just lovely: the story, the actors, the city, the filming. All of it. Beautiful and perfect."
1,Exceeded my expectations.
1,"This has something for everyone!  If you want something good for the whole family this is a great option.  It is so beautifully done that it keeps the younger member's of your family engaged but has such a wonderful story line that the older member's of the family stay engaged as well.  Not to mention that Korra herself teaches lessons of being selfless, compassionate, and ultimately getting up when a mistake knocks you down.  I enjoyed watching this with both my 9 year old who LOVED it and and my hubby (52) who kept saying one more episode, then one more episode, and we were all held in rapt attention!  Now if you have very young ones such as 0-4 then you may want to watch an episode or two to decide for yourself whether you personally think it is appropriate for how you are raising your children because the bending of the elements and using them to fight may be more &#34;cartoon violence&#34; than you want your children seeing.  As for this family we LOVE it!"
1,"Wonderful series, HBO nails it again."
1,I think they ended it well.
1,Brit humor at its best.  Love it!
1,Awesome
0,This is boring movie and goes nowhere. Don't spend your money.
1,i really like the GOT series so i watched it...it is enjoyable
1,Cute movie for Jane Austen fans.
0,Ok
1,"In Season 5 True Blood gets back to its roots after veering off path in Season 4 with all the side stories. It is the good old Vampires, Werewolves and Shape Changers with humans getting in the way."
1,Love this show!
1,Good action thriller. I liked it.
1,Best show ever.
1,Fun
1,"Hesitant about coming of age stories generally, and it started in a pretty textbook fashion, but there were enough twists, and substance to win me over.  A slow pace, but I was glad I watched."
1,He memorized the theme song after the 3rd episode and he is learning a lot.
1,One of the funniest shows I've watched in a long time. The chemistry between actors is something that only comes around about once a decade. I'm very glad to have found it and look forward to the second season.
1,"This is truly an excellent film.  Really depicts life in the USA today, with controlled media<br />and prosecution misconduct."
1,One of the best series from anyone in a long time.
1,Great Show
1,entertaining and refreshing
1,"Great show, I'm disappointed I missed it when it aired originally."
1,"Not as good as season one, but still good.  It seems to be more individual episodes than before, and more geared toward the teenage kids' problems, which are not interesting to me.  I LOVE Alan Cumming as Eli.  Glad he is getting more time in season 2."
1,A fun family friendly film.
0,"I wish I could say it was ok but it was filmed and the dialogue was worse than a bad B movie.  I mean maybe the entire budget was spent on the first few scenes on board the ship because the rest are of the main girl running at Red Rock.  I fast forwarded through most of it hoping it would pick up but it didn't.  The story wasn't even original, it was a mix of Mad Max and Planet of the Apes.  Did anyone else wonder how miss thing could continue running, climbing and fighting for days on what 5 or 6 blueberries.  She is one touch cookie...."
1,Fabulous!
1,Nice movie
1,"A fun, fun movie to watch. Here you have five kids trying to create a movie of there own when they find themselves on run from the Air Force, Sheriff's office and a monster from another planet.I have wanted to watch this movie but forgot all about this film until I saw the title and read the credits. A quite exciting story that is fun to watch."
1,"An excellent mystery that is seemingly inspired by Agatha Christie novels. Hercule Poirot would have been comfortable with this story. Very well acted and photographed. Hope to see more future work from this writer, and director. A very nice way to spend an afternoon."
0,Boring
1,Nice little movie with a good message.
1,EXCELLENT
1,Great lead into Suits.

1,I absolutely love this series can't wait for each and every show to be released . I hate waiting!
1,neat show
1,"A second rate TV show, won't be remembered as anything than that TV show based off one of Stephen Kings books."
0,"Hated the ending, just felt like everyone came in to work one day, and were like WTF, shy is the set closed?  Just ended too abruptly IMO."
1,Husband and I both enjoyed this.
1,Good Movie!
1,"Funny, romantic, sad (but not tragic), and finally uplifting. I have watched this movie twice already. It is well acted,well-written and directed, and I believe Michelle Hendley is an actress to watch. I recommend this movie!"
1,"Good show,well done."
1,Enjoyed it
1,"No blood and over the top sex, a story about real life and the people living it. It also made me think about life and relationships and the journey. Loved it!"
1,Excellent and real. Funny as heck. Love Sharon Hogan!!! Binge watch it...only 6 episodes so it's like a long movie.
1,"As a big fan of Jon Stewart, I decided to check out Trevor Noah.  I was very skeptical, he has big shoes to fill.  I was pleasantly surprised, Trevor is very clever and quite amusing.  I am looking forward to the new show."
1,Excellent show! Story line and actors are great.  Look forward to watching it every week.  Beautiful scenery.
1,"Incredible writing and direction, I am even more addicted. What do you mean there are only 3 seasons??!!!!"
0,"really, 3 minutes in there is a sex scene then it's so bloody....wow, can't watch too many movies anymore....."
1,Fun show

1,"One of the best, if not the greates tv series of all time!"
1,"Great story, great acting.  When do we get more??"
1,Unbelievable!
0,Trashy.
1,Trying to get season 4...
1,Great time travel smart romantic fun good personality developments and character depth. To bad season 3 is not also in the prime package yet.
1,Beautiful scenery. Well acted.
1,It was ok. Great for a kid's movie. But it's nothing like the original Disney Tarzan movie. I definitely didn't like this concept or storyline.
1,this is my favorite show.  I love the narrator!
1,Action packed and fun to watch
1,Awesome. Best series I have seen in years. Can't wait for Season 4!!
1,Awesome. My daughter  loves loves this program....
1,Average

1,Great show
1,Loved it. Clean romance. Excellent acting!
1,AWESOME!!!!!
1,Love this show.
1,good series and looking forward to next season.  my only criticizing is second episode a cult is about to kill its followers and a family is present that was in police protection so could not have been at the  killing sight.
1,Good standard horror fare.  Streaming to a TV is terrible.  I will never pay for Prime to use for video.
1,Great
0,"This was the second worst movie I've ever seen.  The worst was &#34;Barbed Wire&#34; with Pamela Anderson - what does that tell you.  Acting was terrible, by every actor.  It was a strange mix of bible and Sci Fi.  I like Sci Fi.  The editing was terrible as well.  If it's free, go ahead and give it a try but mark my words, it will be two hours out of your life you will never get back."
1,"Very well done without all the present day violence and sex that seems to be so necessary to get good ratings on todays movies, particularly since the topic invited it."
0,Unpleasant mishmash.
1,Awesome show. Shows the true hardship of the Cuban people and what true communism is like. Everyone is &#34;equal&#34; and the black market thrives.
1,"First episode was ok, but the second episode is providing a whole world of excitement and thrill. I can't wait for the upcoming episodes!"
1,Great show
1,Not bad
1,Enjoyable
1,"Star Trek at its best.  Human drama, love interest, and a battle of wits."
1,A fun trippy animation that kids AND parents can enjoy. My boys 6 and 8 have asked to watch it again!
1,Boring.
1,"1st season was great! The 2nd season has dragged a little. Halle Berry looks better with short hair and she was better with her first husband...shouldn't have killed him off.  Also, the story plot for me has taken on a slow uninteresting turn."
1,Best finale of almost any TV show I've ever seen. So satisfying!
1,Gotta have this movie!
0,"Did not like the movie, waste of money"
0,Rides that fine line of so bad it's good then that line of it's so bad I want to stab Jeff Bridges with a truck for his wtf acting and accent!
1,best movie i've seen in a loooong time! highly recommended
0,Ok
1,Loved this movie!
1,This video is so well done.  Well it is Spike Lee! I learned a lot and watched all of it.
1,Sometimes I watch a series just for the actors but this was Interesting to say the least!
1,I would have given it five stars based on the start of the show but I'll leave it at that.  I am happy I watched and would recommend it to someone with 3 hours just laying around.
0,"This was the most frustrating movie I have watched in a long time. I mean, I can't even. I literally can't even."
0,"I wish I had read reviews before I started this movie!!! I watched for less than 3 min. but I was disgusted at how it began, I wouldn't watch any more. Then, I read reviews and it sound like I missed nothing."
1,Love it
1,Fun.
1,Love it!
1,"As powerful as ever. Great performances, great film. Story line still holds up even 46 years later.  I know I'll watch it again"
1,very funny. violent enough to be interesting. excellent Martin McDonagh
1,Surprsingly good movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat and that crazy music/sound track. Definitely going to see the sequel.
1,I was never a big Katy Perry fan.  Pretty much just loaded it up for the kids to watch.  I need to say that my expectations were wrong.  I appreciated how she interacts with the audience and she sounds better live than on the disc.  Of course having the kids dance around singing added to the experience as well.  It is worth watching.
1,"this movie did it for me, to go thru his life this way was amazing, Can not stop looking at it."
1,Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce have alway been my favorite Holmes and Watson.  Well done and well worth watching for the umpteenth time.
0,Enough already!!
1,Survivor has changed a lot over the past 15 years and 30 seasons.  I have to say that season 3 was my favorite.  It was actually focused on survival and not about love triangles.  The best part was that is wasn't on a beach like every season since.
1,Love it
1,Very good sign and image.
1,Great show funny and thought provoking.
1,Great Show.Lots of Action.
1,"I like this show, so I'm watching it again."
1,Outstanding on almost every level.
1,The rock played a great part in this movieðŸ‘ðŸ¼
1,True blood is great
1,"I only watched one episode and I don't think I watched the whole episode. I just couldn't get in to the story, mostly men characters, none that I felt very sympathetic toward. I want to like someone right away. That didn't happen for me. Great actors though, wish I liked  their characters."
1,Great
1,Solid 4 stars
0,Does not crate tension.a big waste of time
1,Excellent telling of the nascent Israeli Airforce. I really enjoyed it and found it extraordinary.
1,"I love Korean movies...that's why it gets a 3 star rating. But, I think I am just being generous..since it is Korean. If you like creepy dolls..check it out."
1,My daughter loves sponge Bob
1,My little one loves this show!
1,Great documentary. I have watched it three time.
1,Good subject just very slow directory. This movie could be done in 45 min.
1,I binge watched Six feet Under for a week and a half. I couldn't get enough. I especially appreciated the very last episode of season 5.
1,Excellent very informative....
1,Not as nearly as good as Divergent and doesn't do the book justice.
1,Definitely not a movie that stars Anthony Hopkins. His role is more cameo. it is a slow moving movie that is not much a thriller
1,One of the best series I've ever watched. Every character is developed and the acting superb. Love it!!
1,An awesome movie.  Was surprised by the selection
0,To stupid to talk about
0,Wasn't that interesting to me..
0,Visually gorgeous and a total flabby bore....
1,Excellent .

1,great
1,Loved it!
1,Great like always
1,Great writing that keeps you engrossed.  And Tatiana Maslany's acting in the five various characters is simply awesome.
0,"Awesome movie... horrible picture quality.  I only bought the standard Def copy, but it was unwatchable.  My old vhs copy is better quality."
1,Really insightful episode. They really showed in an entertaining way what a day in the life of Marc Maron looked and felt like. Perfect.
1,Hard to get into the story line..<br />Too slow moving...
1,"The story really ramps up this season!  In addition JD Morgan has quite the chemistry with Halle Berry.  Kiersey Clemens is another great addition to a great cast!  Her tranquil contemplation of how to analyze, manipulate, and execute is cool and creepy."
1,Most war movies give you action for action sake. This movie takes you into the heart in the mind of a particular operation that took place toward the end of World War 2. The Herting Forest operation was one of the most dismal planned and poorly executed Allied operations in the Western Front. This movie shows this on a personal level. It shows to how personal heroism energies from some of the most unlikely candidates making this a very believable war movie. The themes of how well this movie is written present themselves as an attractive way of mapping out the progress of the movie as it precedes. From carrying friends in the beginning to being carried by friends at the end are the kind of book ends the movie elaborates on in order to follow the cobat by the personal till it takes on the major players and how they died in the midst of this terrible operation. It is a thoughtful and provoking movie that helps you to understand what troops offered in this operation. I recommended it highly for those who want to watch and learn about the real costs of war.
1,"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,"Fantastic story, wonderful acting. We LOVED this movie!"
1,Current facts and pix... wow.
0,"There just wasn;t a story in this movie.  Depended on nude girls to carry the show, and they didn't carry the show."
1,Second time I have watched the entire series! Not sure we would have the resolve to win today!
0,It's an okay movie at best. Hard to believe they can get lost in the &#34;woods&#34; with well defined and clearly marked trails. The Blair witch project it is not. It's only good for a cheesy scary movie marathon.
1,Very interesting!!!!
1,It was fairly good but a bit tedious.
1,"Great character study of both the players and the institutions.Excellent ensemble acting; terrific photography, great writing."
1,"Probably my favorite Duke movie, and that's saying a lot."
1,Pretty good.. Would like to see more
1,"Well written, great characters, great action.  Really enjoy all the locations the show goes to every season."
1,Not our favorite classic Disney but it IS still of school Disney so we liked it enough.
1,Loved it!
1,What a riveting story.
1,"Awesome show!  Suspense, intellectual and very entertaining!"
1,"A touching movie , depicting  the reality of what soldiers and those waiting for them at home, experience."
1,Inspirational!!!!!!'
1,Excellent series better than 24 hours
1,Great spoof flick
1,Love it
1,A new take on a successful British detective series.....using a handsome Vicar to help solve murders.  Loved it!
1,More violent - pushed me to the edge - but hung in there.
1,Good movie
1,must  watch
1,"Touching, heart wrenching, suspenseful, and just a quality movie about a subject I knew little about, which is all the displaced children England sent to Australia.  Emily Watson is a magnificent actress and does well at any movie she is involved in.  Sets, costuming, and secondary actors and actresses did a fine job portraying traumatized adults."
1,I absolutely love this show.
1,Cone on.  It's Spongebob!
1,"This a very entertaining TV show. It is also very informative  not only with the use of science  but it has tones of values,friendships,family responsibility. I was looking for something that would be fun to watch and help my grandkids start early knowing that learning can be fun.  This show is good for pre-teens and above."
1,I love this movie.
1,Good family movie.

0,Could only watch about 10 minutes and it was too fakey.
1,Amazing!!!!!!
1,Good series
1,"More exciting than last season! I couldn't stop watching it, finished it in one day. Waiting for next season!"
1,Great mini series.
1,Most excellent!!
1,"Almost a good movie. Gorgeous scenery. Ludicrous plot, sometimes lame dialogue. I don't want my money back (rented)and I don't feel it was 100 percent waste of my time, but I won't watch again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but a die hard Jackson fan."
1,"We enjoyed this, but, it took me awhile to realize it was a story about the author/creator of Peter Pan.  Once I grasp that it was easier to follow the story."
1,"I really hate that they cancelled this show after the 6th season.  I am a late watcher on this, just started the series back in July when I first got the Fire-Stick (which is amazing in itself)!!  Justified is absolutely the BEST show we have watched in a very long time.  The acting is superb (I think that several of the main actors have won an Emmy, or several, for their performances on this show!  Timothy Olyphant is the best actor, he was made for this part!!!  If you get a chance you need to watch this from season 1, episode 1!!!  You will not be disappointed I promise!!!  We don't know what we are going to do when we finish this series??  We look forward every night to watching at least 2, sometimes 3 episodes!!!"
1,"A sad history lesson, a story to learn from.  I also read the history of the families involved. Their loved ones should be proud of a movie well done."
0,"A little too violent, even for my tastes."
1,This great little show keeps my 2 year old mesmerized.  The short episodes are great because he can watch one or two as a treat just before bed and we don't have to feel like he's spending hours in front of the TV before he can finish his show.
1,Funny guys!
1,Keeps you guessing throughout.  Loved it.
0,The description of this film sounded intriguing....the movie was not....it is painfully slow....boring despite the cast and the possibilities. Lost my attention and soon my curiosity.... wasted my time....save yours....skip  this disaster!
1,"Yet another awesome season of storytelling with compelling characters, most returning and some new. Julianna Margulies and Christine Baranski are the standouts here, with Alan Cumming and Chris Noth adding even more layers! Highly recommend!"
1,This was such a beautiful movie!  Characters very well developed and well acted.  So many subtle twists and turns.  Very touching and very beautiful.  Thanks for streaming this in Amazon!  5 stars from me!
1,Who doesn't love SB!
0,"The movie story itself was ok - light entertainment. However, the sound and the characters talking didn't match up which was distracting. If this is how the movie came out then I can see why ratings were not so good. The side stories were really dumb. Disappointing as Martin Landau and Ellen Burstyn are better actors than the script provided for this film."
0,We did a search for Christian movies. This IS NOT a Christian movie.
0,Dont even remember seeing any part of it.
1,This documentary made me want to read the book.  It was very inspirational.
1,Gr8 movie
0,"Really weak impersonation of one of the best bands of all time. As an Amazon Prime member, I paid nothing for this (and was overcharged.) If zero stars had been an option, I would have rated it that way."
1,What a great interview!! Perfect timing for me as I had just finished season 1. It kept me close to them and nice to see how much preparation and dedication from them all! Worth the watch.
1,It's great. Gives an appreciation of how invasive a political life can be<br />Great law cases presented
1,"I love Will's attakes on the tea party, love Sloan. Some of the episodes almost boil down to angry yelling."
1,Very moving.
1,Don't know whether to hate or like the aliens. It keeps you guessing!  Look forward to seeing the finale.
1,"Love the show,it keeps me excited any it never has a dull moment!"
1,Extremely well acted.  Very real.
0,Too long.
1,"I had to see the end, but it should have ended at the close of season 6"
0,"I did not think that it was a good kid movie. The girl is smart, but feels that she needs to pretend to be dumb in order to be popular. While that may be true in reality, the target age group should be innocent of this social phenomenon. Similarly, the romance was out of place for the target age group. Had the movie been simply about an invention gone awry then it would have been ok."
1,Interesting and surprise you captivating...
1,"This is a well researched and informative documentary, and worth watching just for the interviews with Georgia O'Keefe. How they got her to agree to be interviewed, I don't know, but it says something about the producers that they were able to accomplish this.<br /><br />We've all seen Mr. Strand's photos, so I think the whole point in watching a movie about him is to learn more about him and his life.<br />I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought the (quite brief, actually) segment about his career in film making was slow, as my impression was quite the opposite, and since this is a documentary film and Mr. Strand spent many years as a movie cameraman it's completely logical that this would also be a part of the film, not just his still photography. I thought this segment was very interesting, especially to see his film making style, which reminded me of Sergei Eisenstein's, and which we probably won't see anywhere else, and to learn that he was taking on very serious subjects such as racial intolerance, the KKK, and McCarthyism. Also that his decision to move to Europe was largely because of these issues.<br /><br />Seeing Mr. Strand wielding his monstrously huge Graflex SLR (5x7?) was also a highlight.<br /><br />The musical soundtrack was nothing special, kind of typical of a low budget documentary, but I wasn't watching the movie to listen to the music. The &#34;Ken Burns&#34; style of showing the photos was the weakest and most distracting part of the film for me. I felt that the film makers should have displayed the photos in full view first, and then panned around if they felt the need to push that button on iMovie. If the rest of the film had not been so informative I would have knocked a star off for this, but there was so much else about it that was really good that I kept it at five.<br /><br />I was not surprised at the end to learn from the credits that this film was funded by the Canadian National Film Board. I have watched numerous documentaries funded by this agency, and they have all been of high quality. One can also go to their website and watch a lot of movies for free. Most of them were made by the CBC."

1,Great and excellent!
1,Full of action
0,"I may change my review as the season progresses, but so far this is a lame excuse for a Walking Dead prequel. Where are the vibrant characters and story lines I have come to love from the WD writers?  These people are uninteresting and flat and dumb. By episode 2, I don't care about them at all. I was hoping for a more global view of the initial spread of the virus, but instead I am stuck following a dysfunctional family and an addict - both of which are totally stupid.  BOO.... yet.....I am compelled to watch the next episode even though I have found myself completely disappointed thus far. I am trying to find hope in what seems like a hopeless set of characters I hope will die so we can get on with some new people.<br /><br />WD writers - what were you thinking?????"
1,"Absolutely wonderful. Ben Whishaw is without out a doubt the greatest Shakespearean actor of our day. Rory Kinnear's performance was top notch. His little nuances really showed how reluctant his character was to take the crown. This is worth the watch, even if medieval English historical fiction isn't your thing."
1,Funny clever
1,Awesome!
1,Love it!
1,Love this show!
1,Great movie!
1,A classic.  They seldom do this sort of thing well anymore.  Maybe never.
1,I love the Twilight Zone. Great picture quality.
0,disappointing.
1,This show had my husband and I laughing so hard.  The dialog amounst the characters is hysterical.  Can't wait to see where this goes.....
1,I enjoyed the movie and was happy to see an outcome that justified the pain and suffering endured by the used black women of New Orleans.
0,This is an awful story line and movie.  All justifying rape culture and violence against women.  Watch it only if you want to get angry
1,"I have watched five seasons of Justified & I love the show, but now that I'm at season six they want me to pay for it. I don't understand how they can let you watch all the way to the last season & then want to charge yo."
1,Fantastic
1,Funny
1,"We love this show, and so does my son! Bright colors, music, and the learn curriculum is &#34;spot on&#34; for 2-3 year olds!"
0,Crap
1,AWESOME!
1,Loved it! I've watched it 3 times!
1,Great acting.
1,"FAST,POINGANT,PERVASIVE,HUMAN!"
1,Very funny show.
1,"My first ever series review...this show is ridiculously funny, dark and insightful. Pure comedy genius. Found out tonight that the second season isn't even available yet, marginally devasted as its incredibly moreish. In truth this is the first series that my husband enjoys too. Great characters, well written and perfect comedy timing."
1,"Great acting and story line, very suspenseful."
1,"This was really fabulous.  The acting was superb, and the setting was amazing.  The end of the season is a huge cliff hanger and Season 3 is not out yet....augh!"
1,loved it
0,Not what I expected.
1,love it
1,Awesome
1,"Well written and compently acted, Road Hard follows the life of a stand up comic near the end of his career. The movie was humorous in a dark way , showing the toll this career takes. There were very funny scenes mixed with dramatic ones. The ending does not cause to feel that you wasted time watching this feature. A big fan of Adam Carolla could easily rate it 4-5 stars."
1,"pretty good, muscle shoals is better"
1,"The storyline is intriguing and the plot has twist and turns that definitely keep me interested from episode to episode.  The actors each seem to fit their roles very well.  I don't know what is planned or what will happen next, but I hope this show can continue beyond this first season into season 2!"
1,Great Show!!
1,Just a really fun movieðŸ˜Š
1,Loved it.  I've watched 1-5 2 times
1,we loved it.
1,Really good! The only reason its not five stars is there is ALOT of nudity.
1,"I would give 3.5 stars if I could.  Beautifully made movie.  A bit slow at times, but enjoyable nonetheless."
1,"A very smart, funny comedy for grown ups. It had me laughing out loud in the first few minutes of the first episode, and binged watched the rest. Please make more."
0,"Eh, okay"
1,"Movie is a bit slow initially. Overall, the conspiracy theory of aliens being held in area 51 was quite compelling in this sci-fi movie. The special effects were well executed, but the story line was far from being original. This is a great movie for those rainy days."
1,Still a powerful story 50 years later.
1,"Funny,poignant, sad at the same time."
1,Excellent. Binged watched all 6 seasons. Love having the ability to do that
1,Love this movie.  They do not make them like they used to.  Classic romantic comedy that leaves you with a good feeling.
1,Awesome show
1,Another outstanding Aaron Sorkin series.
0,Acting skill levels of most of cast is poor.
1,Based on a true story. Fantastic Movie.
1,"Interesting movie, but I have mixed feelings about it. I'm not sure I'd call it good exactly, but enjoyable. It certainly doesn't follow the book more than 30% or less, but it's worth watching for its originality. If you like artsy stories, this may be for you."
1,"I thought the first season was sensitively portrayed with a lot of humanity.  The acting was excellent and the character development was mostly good; I had a hard time believing that Sarah would leave her husband and family so quickly and that Tammy would just leaver her wife when she asked, but beyond that I thought the characters were interesting and well-developed."
0,Terrible movie
1,"Just starting, but seems to be a great storyline. Good acting. Looking forward to following this"
1,great series and a fan of the little house cast I just had to  purchase this season .
1,Love it
1,"WORTH COLLECTING THE ENTIRE SERIES TO BE HONEST. I watch 1-6 in a month and really enjoyed this, although the missing actor &#34;patches&#34; were not seamless. it worked to the point that the bow on the package wasn't TOO sappy."
1,"This series is exceptionally good. The dramatic tension and historical detail are stellar. I wonder whether the American series &#34;The Newsroom&#34; was loosely based on &#34;The Hour.&#34; There are differences, of course, but also many parallels. I thoroughly enjoyed both shows, but preferred &#34;The Hour&#34; because it seemed to delve deeper."
1,Loved watching Tangled with my granddaughter. Good strong female role. Repunzel was not a push over.
1,"Fantastic!!!!  Yeah, Keanu Reeves is back!!!"
1,Hilarious.
0,Not a very good movie. Poorly written.
1,long
1,Witty and funny!  Please bring season two!!
1,"It's a shocking, eye-opening view of what the country does to young minds in order to create kill-crazed Marines for service to The Country.  And when they get killed, we call them heroes.  But, nevertheless, very well done!"
1,"I didn't know what to expect, but watched it because of the ratings (thank you other viewers). It's a subtle movie and worth a second viewing to pick up on details. Highly recommend."
1,I love this series!
1,Good movie.  Better than expected!
1,Moving
1,Great viewing for free thinkers!
1,Great overall not anything like other reviews make it out to be!

0,Not on the level of ghost

1,Awesome!
1,It's a good show. Keeps me in suspense.
1,My 7 and 4 year old loved This movie!
1,Hilarious! Larry David is a genius!
1,Very inspiring
1,"I can understand why it was cancelled after 13 episodes.  Just how much &#34;patient needs organ, another dies, person gets transplant&#34; can one take.  I watched it just to see the stars and to try and idenify what shows their now on."
1,"If you like British who done it, this is worth watching."
1,Even better than Season 1!
1,Fantastic movie with a wonderful story.  A true story that touches your heart.
1,Great show - important messages
1,"Great story lines for a kids cartoons, the music is always fun, and those Backyardigans have some pretty slick dance moves!"
1,Crazy but entertaining!
1,Super cute movie!! Loved it!
0,If I could have given this a 0 I would have. There is no point to this film. It's episodic with no revelation. Very I satisfying film.
1,Season 2 of Extant was a good improvement over the second half of season 1.  It's a compelling sci-fi and best of all - Halle Berry!
0,Difficult to understand.  I don't believe we made it past the first five minutes.
1,Nice twists and turns.
1,"A bit of history with an old time Western Shoot-um up theme.  Love the series because, although made up,it followed the real railroad race...  laying track across the country.  It was a grueling race and definitely part of our history.  Good actors and lots of threads woven in to keep one interested."
1,Great movie.
1,once again Victoria makes a great film.
1,Nice  I still watching
1,I had heard about this movie coming out some time ago. I've been a fan of Sharon Leal and Boris Kudjo for quite awhile. The casting was excellent! The chemistry between Sharon and Jason was magnetic and truly believable. Very erotic while still intriguing on the reminder that sex is an addiction and real for many people. I felt the director delivered the message in his filming and made this movie a one to press replay on. Thx!
1,Tha Acting is Awesome!  The storyline is great!!!!
1,A great documentary following two life long best friends that went on to become YouTube legends.
0,Do not recommend.  Violent and twisted.
1,One of the funniest and most irreverent shows ever !
1,Good but I thought 2/4 were done better. Still entertaining.
0,"Never got to watch it, kept erroring. Wasted $2. to stream it."
1,Best action show I have seen in a very long time.  Just wish Season 3 was not $1.99 per show.  Will have to waitl
1,Superb and disturbing film. It should be seen and considered by people who are ambivalent about fundamentalism.
1,Adult viewing only  Entertaining.
1,Chilling thriller with incredible visuals. Be prepared to binge watch.
1,don't like how it made everyone seem so goofy. I know it's for the kids; just wasn't impressed like i was w/ teen titans / legion of super heroes.
1,"Actions pack ,outstanding performance"
1,Excellent performance by Craig. Only minor comments are the russian accents
1,Boring
1,Very riveting. I enjoy the enigma of the whole story
0,"Just a little too unbelievable, even for mindless pap of this kind."
1,"Best damn captain since Kirk, well done"
1,Great special effects and a different twist to the story of the man called Hercules
1,"Done well.  I was even a little surprised here and there by the story.  I thought they were going to go all preachy about the<br />mistreatment of Indians and/or go silly about the wisdom of the native but they didn't go there.  They showed it and if you wanted<br />to draw those conclusions you could.  If those things existed, than this could have happened.  Not much more you ask from a<br />horror movie."
1,Great movie to watch to find out more how criminals minds work.
1,Probably the worst of the series. The new Glee Club was fine but following the old Glee Club was just a bore
1,Great actors!
1,"If you've seen the show, you know what to expect. It felt like a long episode, and some filming outside of the park must have been a nice change for the guys. I'll try not to spoil it, but I liked a surprise awaiting Ricky at the end. If you enjoy the show, you'll like this."
1,"Season $ is just as good as season's 3, 2 and 1."
1,Love his series!
1,"I've only seen the first several episodes, but I like the historical fictional ties to Al Capone and other period organized crime figures."
1,"Not much new material, much of the footage comes from the original series but does answer a few questions."
1,"Better than I thought.  Good movie for kids.  No T&A or bad language. decent story, and funny.  Its for kids."
1,"Loved it, I am hooked and want to know what happens next!"
1,A different kind of scary. Good movie.
1,"Excellent movie, well done and great for educational purposes too."
1,New perspective on Market Garden
1,"Colorful, intense, and romantic movie of a woman's struggle to express the pain, passion,and creative genius of her life in painting and in love."
1,An awesome finale and great tribute to Paul Walkers career.  This edition of FF is more furious than ever!!  Would highly recommend if you enjoyed the others in the series.
1,Laugh Riot!
1,"fun, stirring story that the family can watch together"
1,Typically slow a la 'Smiley's People' LeCarre type writing. Bill Nighy is very good but the plot takes forever to develop. Lost interest halfway through the first episode. May try to watch it again when I am bored...
1,An unusualâ€‹ take on a romcom.  Very sweet.
1,"If you love the Unusual Suspects, you'll love this one as well."
1,love it
1,"no review really needed it worked as expected, clarity good, good movie."
0,Not appropriate for under 12.

1,"When can we see the next episode?  You tease us with a pilot and its been a month,  where are the rest of the story???"
1,Good movie
1,"More, more!!!"
1,"Another awesome show by the writer of The West Wing, Aaron Sorkin! I'm hooked!"
1,Great great great- just gets better with time!
1,It was funny but slow.
1,Well written and acted crime series.
1,A very good story. Well acted and with several surprise twists. We enjoyed it.
1,"I wish I could give this movie both 1 star and 5 stars.  After watching it, I thought... I never want to see that again (In much the same way I never wanted to see Schindler's List again), and then I watched it again for a Film, War and Propaganda class and I still feel that way.<br /><br />It's a GREAT movie.... but fak it's hard to watch"
1,"Great Movie, but unfortunately Amazon has cut several great parts out. Very disappointing."
1,"So richly informative! I have been wanting to watch a Ken Burns documentary for awhile and am so grateful they are available on Amazon Prime. Living in Oklahoma, I wanted so much to learn more about this pivotal time in our history. I've appreciated the in-depth look, not just at what it was like to live in that time, but all the factors that led up to the events. I had never heard most of the facts regarding how this disaster was man-made or what brought &#34;no man's land&#34; to that point. I really appreciate that this video gives first-hand accounts, focusing on real families and individuals and how they were personally affected by all that occurred. It gives a realistic, yet personal view of history while giving me the opportunity to truly consider what it must have been to live through something so devastating. Truly powerful. My one complaint is simply the length - but that &#34;complaint&#34; is meager, as it does not drag or seem needlessley lengthy. It takes awhile to get through, but there is a lot of information to cover."
1,Interesting bio. Michael Douglas was amazing. And that Matt Damon.gorgeous and also great acting.  Courtney at the end
1,My 3 year old grandson loves these videos. He is starting pre school and the stories relate perfectly to his interests.
1,Wifey loves it. She always try to put a suit on me. I fight back as hard as I can
1,Thought it was a great haunted house story
1,I loved this series.. Its a shame they canceled it..
1,Awesome show
1,A great film for the military historian.  Beautifully done.
1,"Part of the story you probably never knew, fantastically portrayed!"
1,Beautiful train wreck
1,I'm normally  not into rom com's especially a series. But I tried this one based on the reviews and I have to say IT'S FUNNY!!!<br /><br />Highly recommended obviously for Adults only!!
1,Horrible writers. By the fifth show the story line repeats.
1,"I loved this movie---funny and poignant.  It has a narration reminiscent of The Wonder Years, as the filmmaker details his fascination with Paul Williams. Like the movie Searching for Sugar Man, the subject of the movie is presumed dead, yet is very much alive. Songwriters and musicians especially will like it, but so will anyone who likes a good story with an uplifting ending."
1,Best show of the summer! Always leave you wanting more and never disappoints. A MUST watch!
1,"Always like this show, was glad to find it on prime."
1,Awesome movie!!  Very sad to see him make it through four tours of duty and then to be killed by someone he was trying to help.  God bless his wife and children!!
1,Great show! A good mix of humor and serious content. The cast is top notch and the chemistry works well.
1,Great show!
0,Horrible
1,it's based on a true story. it helped me to realize how careful around dogs I need to be.
1,"I've watched several movies, youtube videos, online clips of a variety of people traveling the Camino de Santiago and I think this one is more realistic of how thing are on the trail and what to expect if you plan on going.  It shows the good and bad, and how people express their day to day life being on this journey.  5 stars for being authentic!"
1,Who still doesn't like gangster shows?
1,"Darker then I thought, but good movie overall. Wiig and Hader give great performances. Not a traditional &#34;feel good&#34; comedy by any stretch of the imagination."
1,Very intertaning
0,"Characters drew us in but became more and more depressing and dark.  There may have been silver lining but someone let it mold in a dumpster.  Wish we'd have quit after Pilot, but there seemed to be promise.  The promise turned out to be accurate to the corrupt political environment of the story.  We use to like Rhode Island."
0,"Didn't expect to like this movie and I didn't. Not terrible, just bad."
1,Excellent viewpoint - show stresses conscientious effort one should put forward. Makes me feel there is still hope for the count
0,Diane Keaton is usually a favorite but not in this movie.
1,Stops my kids in their tracks every time - they love it!
1,Really fun and imaginative show!
1,"I had to watch this movie again after hearing a friend talk about the movie the other day.  It had been years since I watched the movie.  So many funny moments in the show.  His discovery of his &#34;special purpose&#34;, finding out he can easily keep time to so called &#34;white&#34; music, the part where he thought the shooter hated oil cans, then the Coke machine, and other funny segments.  Great fun!"
1,Entertaining and funny.  A great show for the family.
1,Credible plot line and excellent acting
0,kinda sucks

1,Can't wait until Prime has it for free Season #4
1,Well written and great acting and timing which is so important in comedy
1,a GREAT MOVIE. Five stars.
1,"This is a great story and my wife and I enjoyed this movie. Be sure to have some tissue handy because some scenes get a little intense and is sure to pull on your heart strings. All the actors, and especially the stars, seemed to work really well together and liked making this movie. This movie is all in all a grim reminder of the horrors and hardships of human conflict and especially the toil it takes in the homes of those involved as well as the battlefield."
1,Loved this show
1,Have been a fan since the 1st one.  Seems they have gotten better each time.  Love the old AMERICAN muscle cars in the movies.
1,Whitaker's acting is the only reason I gave this movie a 4-star rating. Few other major actors could have pulled this other-wise pedestrian plot off nearly as well.
1,Kept us interested from start to finish!
1,Good performance by Maggie
1,I'm a Downton Abbey Fan!  I can watch this over and over...can't wait for Season 6!
1,A lot more interesting and original than most cartoons
1,I love all things Lucy!!

1,We are enjoying it.  Their handling of current issues is enlightening and entertaining.
1,Meh..
1,"Really good movie, it actually surprised me on how well it was done."
1,Great stuff
1,Total Game-changer. Brought evidences I've never heard about and explains all the discrepancies I've ever heard of regarding the Exodus.
1,Classic movie. ..fun to watch
1,A real black movie reminds me of the old days when men we're men..
1,Love this show. Really funny and true to life.
1,"If you forget everything you know about The Walking Dead and watch this as a regular Zombie show, it starts off pretty good."
1,We love the action and chemistry of the characters.
1,it's great!
1,"Just plain fun, with rich character and a bit of witchery to top it all off."
1,Stayed fairly close to the book.
1,great for kids
1,"Great show, a bit slow and sad. Acting and situations are spot on."
1,Light hearted and sexy entertainment. I enjoyed it!
1,5 stars
1,Great historical content.
1,Anson Mount is excellent in his role. The story line is one that keeps you waiting for the next episode. As we say in our house when we are ready to watch &#34;We've got to build this railroad&#34;.
1,Interesting look at the remote area of the Russian Siberia.
1,"This is a great performance presented with high production values.  If you only have the band's first five albums (!!!) as I do, there will be several songs that you won't recognize.  Scott Gorham and Michael Schenker appear as guests and are awesome.  Highly recommended."
1,Loved it!
1,"slow, but interesting"
1,We  really enjoyed the twists and turns this season and eagerly await the next!<br /><br />When will it start?
0,Not what I like too savage !
1,"Entertaining, but a little bit of simple story. Expected more heroics and a lot less flashbacks. The story line is predictable but the action is great to watch! Def something I recommend to watch."
1,Nobody does estates like the Brits or makes documentaries about them! Well done!
1,thnezsnbetfgnbt

1,Hits pretty close to home. The future is now!
1,It's  Larry David!!!
1,Always a classic.  I have loved this movie since I was a kid!
1,It's Oz..
1,"This series is uber-popular for a reason. It's been accused of being a high-brow soap opera, but it really is so much better than that. Great writing, great acting, gorgeous locations, sumptuous clothing... great stuff!"
0,Only finished half the episode; not particularly compelling.
1,I really like this show.
0,Sucks
1,Great family movie
1,"Love Veep , but didn't care about Let's Kill Ward Wife very much & wouldn't watch it again"
1,Season four was a lot of fun and eventful with some changes that keep your interest.
1,Awesome
1,"This is a rare movie that captures what it was like to be young and in love in mid-Sixties Philly.  I watched those dance shows faithfully and would have &#34;died on my 18th birthday just to have one slow dance&#34; on either Discophonic Scene or Summertime at the (Steel) Pier.  If there's any way to get this deserving movie out on dvd, I'd love it!"
1,Very informative. Well worth watching.
1,"Helen Mirren is amazing in this movie! My wife felt there was perhaps a little too much disjointed visual flashback and not enough on the legal tasks and on family in the USA itself. The movie was a special treat for my wife and I, as we have been to Vienna and recently saw the painting itself in NYC. Hector Feliciano, who had nothing directly to do with recovering these particular paintings but whose book &#34;The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy To Steal The World's Greatest Works Of Art &#34; ignited the world's sensitivity to the issue, was a student of mine at Columbia."
1,"very good production, and well documented."
1,loved it.  Great acting and good story
0,"I generally like goofball humor like Monty Python, but I couldn't sit through this entire movie."
0,"Touching, slow, a movie for teens."
1,"Good action movie, but not very realistic. Lots of bad language or it would get a four stars rating."
1,Loved the love story
1,Interesting story line about the invasion of earth and fighting back.
1,"decent tactics and muzzle awareness, great show, entertaining."
1,"In 1993 in Beatrice, Nebraska the high school put on a play called the gallows. An accident occurred on stage were Charlie was hung. Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler)  joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.<br /><br />The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films.  We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming. I liked it. The problem I had with the twist is that there is a &#34;discovery&#34; of things that happened 20 years ago, secrets I didn't think would exist in a small town where everybody knows everyone's business.<br /><br />Guide: 1 whispered F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,An amazing story about the very earliest days of the Israeli Air Force and the contributions of Jewish-American pilots. Fascinating interviews with the surviving pilots and well-documented.
1,I'm still disappointed it ended at 2 seasons.
1,One of the best shows off of cable television! It has a lot of fast paced action and a great script not to mention a phenomenal cast. What more could you want?
1,"Good food for thought.. it is nice to know that, as a race, we are one inene or stupid."
1,I love this show. I can't get enough of it. So sorry season 6 will be the last.
1,True blood is a great series and fun to watch.
1,Best show on T V
1,Still one of my all time favorite TV series
1,I'm a fan of the book.  I thought the casting was very well done.
1,Love this show
1,Always liked this movie.
1,"Great Show, Kids can't get enough."
0,Did not like this movie!  Was expecting a Biblical rendition . .  not fictional.  This will totally confuse people that are looking for the truth through a movie rather than through reading/study.
1,nothing to say here...just increasing the star ratings of one of the best shows ever made...
0,boring
0,If u like campy this movie is for u.
1,This show has definitely put all other law shows to shame.

1,its ok  but wouldn't wait on the next-show
1,Second time through the series and it's as good as ever!
1,Good show. Binge watching is the way to go.
1,Absolutely love it!<br />Have become addicted to it......
1,"Great movie kept me engaged who time<br />,"
1,"I was taught things I never knew before.  Honestly, I had never given a thought as to how the Israeli Air Force was formed."
1,"Kids loved this one!  Spooky but not too much for a 5-year-old (though he needed mama to hold his hand).  Great mystery and magic, and thrilling footage of horses!"
1,Loved it but I would watch Alex Guarnaschelli peel potatoes. I have seen her on Chopped and she is so mentoring there not just critical. She is tough cookie in the kitchen but when people have problems you can see her get emotional. I think she is a tiger in the kitchen admire her and think she is just a great person and love to listen to her talk about her daughter.  Symon is a great mentor too the other to chefs not as familiar with but the Tyler guy seemed great with his cooks.<br />Thought contestants were really talented but thought the wrong person won but I always think that.
1,I like that it didn't drag on before showing the zombies
1,Smart.
1,Kids like it very much and it's a good show to teach manners and interesting things in life.
1,"So when is the last time a movie, as long anticipated as Fury Road, has been even half as satisfying as this one? Never...this is movies done right and blew me away with the care, imagination and visuals this movies exudes constantly. Paying attention Hollywood???? There is no yuppie new (therefore cheaper) kid director out to prove his chops, only the guy that made the first movies and was obvious personally invested in the movie's success. I'd say he has struck oil with this latest installment. An absolute must watch for any action junkie and anybody else out there that wants to see a non-stop, flame spurting, spike impaling, machine gun firing, grenade throwing, mechanical claw ripping, blood transfusing, body powdering, people crushing, bike jumping, gun blasting, fantabulous movie."
0,"You have to get past the over-acted dubbed American English voices and it may be a cute movie for some kids, but even our 8 yr old grandson found it unbelievable and silly."
1,Fantastic program
1,loved it
1,My dad and I watched every Star Trek TV show We watched all the spin offs. Big Fans Can't believe we missed this one. It is Great!!! Watching
1,"Although this is Season 5, we have enjoyed watching this show. You leave off watching it feeling clean and having had learned something, unlike it's American counterpart."
0,Iv signed up to prime to watch seaaon 4 as it says its free but wen i go on my prime account it says i hav to pay wat is this all about
0,There was no plot
1,Great
1,GREAT WATCH THANK YOU
1,Entertaining and provactive
1,unreal- but  fun to watch----
1,Touching :)
1,"Great show, shows you why you  do not want to be a Lawyer"
1,"A good story, if not a bit predictable."
1,Our whole family loved it!
1,Hilarious!
0,good actors but really bad stupid movie.  highly disappointed so much so that we could not finish watching the movie.
1,It was an interesting  documentary entertaining.  I of course love that subject. .....GHOSTS & HAUNTINGS.  Worth the  look.
1,Best show on prime
1,The most appealing aspect of this version of The Avengers is the time spent on the characters and their relationship to one another. This is done without diminishing the action with is plentiful and spectacular.
1,Hilariously vulgar
1,A great movie.
1,I felt that this was too gory and sensationalized the regular things that many of the movies focus on these days.  Had some great moments.  I only watched the first one.  It was amazingly well acted.  But too much focus on sensationalizing historical current day interests and not enough character development.
0,Under the Dome keeps getting worse and worse by the  episode. I only watch because I read the book. Other than the fact t hat there is a dome it no longer has any semblance to the original book and story. They need to find a way to end the show. Maybe just have everyone morph into some slimy ooze and slither off the screen.
1,Great show so far.
1,Worth watching!!! I love this series.
1,"Great shirts, enjoy them. Would enjoy it more if I could skip through- my kids ask for specific videos. Just need to figure that out. Great content."
1,My three year old is obsessed!!!
1,Very well done !  Right at one favorite !
1,"This program is on a typical subject with a different approach.  I enjoyed the humor, the characters.  For all the grief going on, he still maintains a really nice personality.  Can't wait for the next episodes!"
0,"Horrible.  Great the first several episodes, then a very odd, rushed ending that was ridiculous.  I want those hours of my life back."
1,Excellent story teller and engaging in presentation.
1,This is not season 1 but season 5.  They need to correct their title or actually get the rights to stream season.  Otherwise this is a great show and I hope that BBC will allow the rest of the seasons to stream in the US.
0,A great premise that was pissed away by being 15 minutes too long.
1,Fun to watch light acting
1,"beautiful pictures of the universe, some interesting information  about what  scientist are discovering"
1,Best show ever. I have watched it 4 times... Addicted.
0,"In terms of fun, this is a three-star movie because I like the genre very much. But if you are looking for a new angle on &#34;the old guy mentors the young guy and then what happens&#34; structure you won't find it here and at a certain point, the movie just gets a bit breezy. Still, I am glad I watched it, just as I am glad I watched Rounders. I enjoy this type of movie. So, if you are like me, you will have a good time and not feel cheated. If you are looking for innovation, though, just walk on by."
1,Always great
1,Really great show... The cgi is amazing. The story is line is interesting... For a made for TV series its awesome.
0,Really???
1,Loved it and honestly it was much better than the book!
1,Very funny..
1,Love this series
1,I like this show so I'm watching it again!
1,Good show. Giovanni is great as usual. I would like to see more.
1,Entertaining
1,I watched all six seasons in about 3 weeks! One of the best shows ever on television.
1,Love Barbara
1,Great for kids and excellent subtle jokes that make it entertaining for adults. Either you love it or hate it; doesn't seem to be much middle ground.
0,Just a bad movie
1,Great show!
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»
1,Funny but does have it's off the wall weird parts.
1,"I love the fast and the furious series of movies, out of all of them, this was second best.  Fast 5, to me, was the best, Tokyo drift was the worst."
1,Best show on television!!!
1,Definitely not for kids! Had some great funny moments.
1,Great
1,Very suspenseful and ingenious plots
0,Felt like I was watching a perfume advert there so much philosophizing going on.
1,Good
1,"This is a great movie! As you know, the movie &#34;The Man Who Knew Too Much&#34;, this is a remake of the Hitchcock. This is one of the rare cases where the remake is created much better than the original. I think this film is a benchmark of a Thriller and tension. Legendary actor James Stewart  reliably played an exemplary family man who is forced to participate in a very difficult and dangerous business. This film was made over half a century ago, but until now staging Hitchcock captivates and causes a lot of experiences. Indeed, Hitchcock unsurpassed master of the psychological Thriller!"
1,"My 7-yr old daughter and I watched this together on prime video, and we both enjoyed it completely.  My daughter has now watched it many more times and is desperate to see a next episode.  I sincerely and deeply hope that this show is continued and a full season released!"
1,Kids loved it
1,"This season is darker, not as fun as first two but still well done."
1,Great movie!
1,Great Show
1,Pixar created another great Toy Story short!
1,Very good
1,"A tastefully filmed, acted and presented look into a different culture and the impact of a radical religious cultural 'invasion'.  The film is paced beautifully to reflect the lives and people of the country and area.  The horrific personal and family disruptions within a stable and old culture by the invasion of radical Islam gives the viewer an idea of what is happening in the middle East currently and has happened over the centuries."
1,Great acting. Beautiful scenery.
0,Poor story line and bad acting. Hawaii is assume.
1,The dialog and the characters are superb.
1,Great pilot. Keep it up!
1,Enjoyable
1,Awesome casting.  Perfect (quotable) dialog. Stunning cinametography. Award winning performances. Win win all around!
0,"If you remove the &#34;F&#34; word and it's variants, you'd lose half the dialogue."
0,Didn't watch it because it started out with bad language
1,"Funny, bold, and insightful.."
1,Very good thus far.<br />A more objective analysis can only be provided at the completion of the scenario.
1,anxiously waiting for season 3 Loved it  Great concept well played love the writers point of view...and HB is amazing..... Do not miss this its very special....
1,Good movie
1,Good plot line but I can't tell if the season ended or not.
1,I had a problem with the casting choices. It's so important. The two main characters were fine but everyone else was lacking.
1,The chemistry between these two has me laughing out loud! Very well done!
0,great story......but cheaply put together 2 stars
1,"The story tries to make the myth a mere story humans made up, but it lacks imagination."
1,"Enjoyed the quick season. Six episodes that covered too much ground. What is left for another season? Storyline is a bit unrealistic but the actors are on their game, especially Ms. Horgan and the &#34;Chris&#34; character. The most off putting thing was whether Rob was Jim Gaffigan doing his Will Ferrell impression (or the other way around)!"
1,"Great season and sad that it's the last of true BBC Top Gear for me but glad that Amazon has come to an agreement with Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond for a new show."
1,Wish I could of watched next season free.
1,Great family movie
1,"Funny series, but I find the excessive use of swearing to be distracting and off-putting."
1,entertaining in a made for TV sort of way
0,It got pretty pretentious.
1,Simply awesome !
1,Very much enjoyed his focus and drive. Great film.
1,Love the spiritual in depth movies.
1,Fun to watch again!
1,Remembered a lot of the scenes from the book. They were consistent with my imagination.  Only negative is it is sometimes hard to understand the strong accents.
1,"Tim Currey at his best.  Highly quotable and just good fun.  If you liked Murder By Death, you will definitely enjoy Clue."
0,Pretty goofy
1,Great show
1,Wish there were more high quality shows like this.
1,Liked the book better !  Somehow you know her better in the book and have a feeling of &#34;being there&#34; with her...not so much in the movie.
1,"Funny, Great Movie."
0,This movie was pretty terrible. Everything seemed pretty two dimensional
1,Excellent mystery with very good writing and acting
1,tom needs to go to yhe rest home. give it up.
1,ok
1,Little onE loves it
0,Rather boring
1,"A funny, light and campy outer space adventure. It almost felt like a live play at times. I won't spoil it by telling you who the villain was, I'll let you watch it."
1,Very good story!
1,Love it. Very authentic to the time.
1,This is a fantastic movie! Great music (old and new) and a great message!
1,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is an amazing show. It was aimed towards young children/teens, but it is enjoyable by all ages. Avatar has excellent character building and story lines. The show is great at depicting moral dilemmas that will leave you just as torn as the characters themselves. Although the story is complete, it will leave you wishing it was not over so soon."
1,"great suspense, keeps your attention.  Just one fatal flaw in the plot but I guess that's Hollywood."
1,Ready for it to wind down . . .
1,Lots of action and suspense
1,I have learned many things watching his tv series.
1,Fantastic movie with so many issues addressed.  Thoroughly enjoyed this film!
1,Love this show!
1,Excellent show
1,Can't  wait for season 6
0,"I was 11 when the first TMNT movie came out. It was dark, mysterious, and adventurous. Not am I biased towards this movie because of the history TMNT holds within me. But, I am just not a fan of these hyper explosive transformer genre we've been seeing."
1,Decent movie.
1,"A fun show, hampered by a bit of miscasting, with occasional plot holes big enough to drive a half-ton truck through. Overall fun and worth my time, but not so compelling to make it binge-worthy."
1,Good corporate drama
1,"It stars off slower than the Walking Dead did.  They build the characters up more in the first episode.  I feel it is going to be a good one,"
1,An interesting telling of the emperor Nero though I did not like the major historical changes that they made to his story to enjoy the plot. Though it does show the problems between Nero and Agrippina it does not truly show how his mother was dispatched. Overall it was fine but the inaccuracies made it not as good as it could have been.
0,Way too violent for me!
1,"This is for hardcore students of Chinese history only, or perhaps students of Chinese language who want to hone their skills, as it is in Chinese and also has sub-titles.<br />It's in a very dry scholarly interview style and actually I didn't finish it because I felt at some point that I had gotten what I was after and it was somewhat repetitive."
1,"Loved this movie, great relationship between Robert Redford and Morgan freeman, loved it!"
1,well done & good story line
1,Non stop action<br />Ed Harris superb
1,Great show
1,"I started off not much caring for Captain Janeway, but after watching six seasons, she is growing on me. The writing and storylines seem to have gotten better -- and, of course, there's always Seven of Nine to ogle during slack spots in the action. Although, I have to say her acting has improved somewhat and she is no longer just the eye candy she was when first brought on board the show (ratings reportedly jumped more than sixty percent with her addition to the cast.) Anyway, watching the show now on Amazon or Netflix is a welcome respite from a busy day."
1,"having cut the cable cord it is nice to know I can still watch reruns of my old favorites! actually, one of the best parts of no cable is that I only watch my favorites and Andy Griffith is one of the great oldies."
1,"Longtime Survivor fan. I watched season one when it first came out, and now watching the series over again with my eldest son, who thinks it's the best show ever made. Good stuff."
1,"A good show, with interesting characters. Hoping the next season gets better, though."
1,Great movie
1,Good movie for date night!
1,Love this movie!
1,Great viewing; I can't wait for season 2!
1,Cute movie.  I was happy to see that it was pretty family friendly.  Uncommon nowadays.
1,Funny!!!
1,"This season was so explosive from one episode to another!! I could not stop watching! I am sad that it ended and wished there was another season coming!! There has to be, this cannot be the end!!"
1,Very entertaining. Picture quality is obviously not as good because of the age of the movie.
1,Hu ah
1,Love MIB movies.
1,Too much of a silence of the lamb been there done that Monkey see Monkey do feeling. Too monotonous way too monotonous.
1,Love it! ! So sad it is over.
1,Amazing!!!
1,The series is most interesting to me because I am fascinated with the way the people interact with each other.  The series also makes me wonder it the series is a true reflection of hig powered legal firms.<br /><br />Enjoy watching!
1,"Love the show! Wish it had gone on for a few more seasons but since it didn't, it's nice knowing Amazon Prime has it available. Watched the entire series over the course of a couple months. Love it!"
1,I really like this show and hope that there are more seasons to come after Season 3
0,terrible
1,I devoured four seasons in four days.  This show is spectacular.
1,Very frustrating to watch the legal system at work in this film.
1,"Very interesting, but a bit overly dramatic at times.  Beautifully filmed.  Warning:  it will give you severe wanderlust!"
1,This was an interesting story but not an exciting story. I felt sorry for Chris and his siblings but it can be depressing to see so much dissension between parents and their children as well as parents who evidently do not want to admit to any of their own apparent shortcomings.
1,Elle Fanning and John Hawkes are excellent.  Story is real and more than a little depressing.
1,A well done effort by Ken Burns
1,Some of the graphics were a little crappy in my own opinion (Example: Splinter) Good overall movie though. Definitely worth watching if you're a big TMNT fan.
1,Too many hole in this plot.  Sort of fun if you try not to think though.
0,not so good..boring
1,"I'm hooked! I do admit that it has gotten even more bizarre, but that's just how Stephen's work usually goes. Hard to tell where it's going next, but that too is part of what I love about it. I'm invested in the characters and their futures. I'm looking forward to watching more!"
1,Amazing true story of survival that few can relate to. Worth watching!
0,Couldn't finish it. Didn't feel invested in it at all.
1,"ridiculously funny begining, and lots of laughs all the way through.  Jack Black is just funny to watch."
1,Good believable futuristic movie.
1,"For starters it OK , would watch if made into season"
1,"Either I old and forgetful, or there are a lot of re-runs tied into some new scenes.  Not as interesting as the first 4 seasons."
1,gripping wanted to keep watching
0,"Couldn't stay with it, Boring and stupid are two words I would use to describe it"
1,Better than expected with edge of the seat scenes.
1,Love it! Love it!
1,it was OK not true to story but ok
1,top of the sci fi!!
1,one of the best series of its kind.
1,"Dialogue is a little much at times, the characters can be somewhat 1-D, but the story is interesting."
1,Such a great show. Both of my girls love it (ages 3 and 5). Good story lInes and model good behavior. Curious kids and this curious monkey have a lot in common!
1,LOVED IT
1,Great acting! We loved it! Wish there were more!!!
1,"Smart, sophisticated, funny and serious.  Best TV show I have ever seen.  No kidding.  Too bad it was cancelled after a very short Season 3."
1,Giovanni Ribisi is excellent you can see his wheels spinning with every lie he tells. Looking forward to seeing more.
1,He is a cool john wayne
1,I have watched this show since the beginning and enjoyed it very much.  This time my daughter was here and we enjoyed it together.  Much more fun!
1,Excellent
1,I think they're getting the hang of it...  The screen writers that is.<br />Best season yet...!
1,"This series is so addictive and touching, its tough not to binge- watch!!<br />I savor each episode and wish there would be a continuation after Season 5."
1,Was not able to finish watching it.
1,This was a wonderful movie. I wish there were more like it.
1,Slight spoiler.  Great movie...you kinda root for the killer in most of his killings.  Enjoyable slasher movie.  No kids or animals hurt..
1,"Fantastic performances, witty script, great message."
1,I enjoyed the movie. Simple plot. Lots of shooting. Lol b
1,Absolutely one of the best shows.  Not sure why they took it off.  We miss it.
1,&#34;High School&#34; funny. Story line reminds me of Agent Cody Banks but to a higher level. The kids will love it.
1,one of the best comedy series ever
1,My kids liked it.<br />Decent cast.  decent story.
1,"Kinda saw it coming. The first season was really good. Second season I felt they kinda messed up what made the show interesting, but it had its positives. Third season went way off the rails and basically turned into something that viewers never signed on for. Plus it seemed to start running in circles. Still, I enjoyed it while it lasted and I did like some of the character development (even though other characters were horribly written and made no sense from one action to the next)."
1,Great
1,Really enjoyed this movie.  Would purchase again.
1,Perfect as always!!!
1,Interesting story and well done movie
1,This show was ALWAYS better than the Sopranos and is one of HBO's finest shows!!! A must watch!!
1,Haven't seen this in years! It was great!
1,Love this show...
1,Interesting story line. Hard to hear all the voices. A lot of mumbling. Plot was very slow to develop.
1,"Predictable but enjoyable.  Like the updated story-line and the acting.<br /><br />Nice, feel good movie...just the way I like them."
1,wonderful story!
1,A god?? involved in way too many midevil battles.
1,"One of my favorite seasons! Written incredibly well, and story line is amazing."
1,Real life
1,excellent series.....
0,"I watched for a while, hoping it would get better, but it's too same, same, same. Boring and crude."
1,great
1,Loved it!
1,I would defiantly watch this series!  It was funny & suspensful and unlike any other show on television right now!
1,Sharpe and witty
1,Hilarious every time!
1,Great story ...done well. The injustice has been shown.
1,My 2 year old granddaughter loves Peppa!
1,"I have enjoyed all the seasons.  Very nice series, with multiple story lines.  I have just learned that next season will be their last, so sorry to hear that!"
1,Interesting. Kept me entertained.
1,Was very good! My girls loved it!
1,LOVE THIS SHOW!!
1,"Good, cute show for preschoolers."
1,"It was great!  This picture was exactly what it was supposed to be:  thrilling!  If I had been sitting in a movie house in 1924, this would have scared to bejesus out of me!  I enjoyed it very much"
1,Saw it on Amazon Instant Video.....An excellent video if you've never seen it. Seen Rodriguez in person 3-4 times...what a performer and person!
1,Finally a show with a plot and one that is easy to follow from one season to the next.  Great acting and very addicting.
1,"Jeffrey Tambor's performance as a retirement-aged person who decides to finally, publicly identify as transgender is heartfelt. The story of his family and how they are affected by his life changes and his coming out to them at this point in his life and theirs is mixed with warmth, humor and sadness. It is a story of human failings and family dysfunction. Judith Light is almost a caricature of an aging Jewish mother, the long divorced wife of Tambor's character. The behavior of their three, mostly middle-aged adult children is beyond annoying, as they are the most self-centered, spoiled and hopelessly unaware group of adults imaginable. And yet they each have their moments of human compassion. This story is a testimony for social inclusiveness."
1,I could watch this over and over
1,A+
1,Clever show. Can't wait to see what happens next.
1,A truly feel good movie
1,Love it
1,Awesome
1,It was ok. I thought it was an interesting take on the greek myth. Its not one of the Rocks better roles but wasnt horrible. I'd probablyâ€‹ watch it again
1,This show sucked me in I love it
1,It was not overwhelmingly moving.  The acting was sub-par.  My opinion.
1,"What a great film!  Very entertaining and inspirational story of three navy airmen who  had to ditch their plane in the Pacific during WWII.  The challenges facing them was enormous, but typical of &#34;the greatest generation&#34;, they never panicked, but struggled day by day to survive. We need more films like this."
1,good action and fast moving
1,Not a very good movie to watch. Nothiung but junkies and their drugs very pathetic.
0,Super slow nothing good really happens till the last 10 min and never was that scary
1,This is a serious warning to human beings having desire of longer life.  The touch of the movie is so calm that I felt rather frightened with the reality described there.
1,"Crazy, you'll like it."
1,Cute movie. Great for a night/day in.
1,Great Sci-Fi series
1,This gives a very good account of the history of the Temple Mount. It explains a lot of the controversary going on today!
1,A suave and sophisticated series with great acting.  Watch it.
1,Best movie EVER.
1,Enjoyed the movie. The mother & Frankie seemed believable.
1,Very funny!!!
1,Captivating
1,Another great read!  John
1,Good series!
0,"Total s***, and waist of time and money......"

1,"Wasn't really sure what to expect, but Free The Nipple is thought-provoking, yet sufficiently entertaining.  Not really a comedy, per se, though the Amazon posting seemed to state that comedy was one of the elements."
1,cute!

1,Enjoy watching the show. Baker & Coleman are great. Many talented guest stars as well! Worth a view.
0,"Way to predictable, not enough in depth character development."
1,I love this show! Buscemi is amazing and so different from the comical parts I'm used to seeing him in.  It was easy to get drawn in to the series and have been binge watching it ever since. The whole cast is great and the characters are fun to watch (even though many of them don't last very long). And you don't have to be into the mob type of shows to enjoy this.
1,"Great action, loved it"
1,I loved the opening scene with the so familiar zombie chasing someone inside a decaying house and then we realize that the rest of the world is still normal with regular people and airplanes in the sky. The blended family storyline was actually a interesting though we know their little everyday problems will not matter compared to what lies ahead. The mother was a little annoying fretting so much over her drug addict son. And why on Earth would the step father go into a crack house to investigate a possible homicide instead of alerting the police? I have to admit I fell asleep the first time waiting for Zombie action. Still I found the story engaging though I am not sure I care yet whether the characters survive the apocalypse.
1,Great show!
1,Amazing! One of he best children's shows available for so many reasons. As an adult I am mystified by the amount of work that must go into the artistry of this stop-motion styled production.
1,"Finally, some great TV!  This show is one of the best we have we seen in a long time. Great actors and writing!"
1,Good movie.  Very colorful!
1,Great story with unseen turns in plot.
1,Can't wait for the finale
1,Very unique movie.
0,Just plain stupid.
0,I like both lead actors so I was surprised at how not good this movie was.  I was very disappointed.  Not worth watching
0,"The movie had a good flow to keep you interested, if you like action movies."
1,Good
1,"I like Daniel Tosh, he is an accomplished comedian, sometimes over the top but a very funny guy and the internet videos that he puts on his show, well I'm not sure how he finds them but they are some of the wildest I've see"
1,"I Want to Live! is a surprisingly dated, rather creaky film noir, even though made as late as 1958.  The reason is that it's purpose was to crusade against the death penalty.  The film was made after much lobbying by Ed Montgomery, a newspaperman who opposed the death penalty and the film itself is warped at every point to make its central character, Barbara Graham, the character played by Susan Hayward, appealing to the audience.  Despite the ham-handed efforts to secure our sympathies for Graham, the film works well enough on its own terms as Graham is finally executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin.  The ending has power to shock even though the stage management by the director is clumsy and leaden.<br /><br />The Graham story is in fact a good deal more nuanced than you'd ever know from the movie, which makes it appear that Graham is condemned on the basis of purged testimony obtained through a plea bargain.  Ironically, the real Graham story was a good more of a noir story than the one depicted in I Want to Live! and would have been far more interesting than the one-dimensional screed which made it to the screen."
0,Story was boring. No plot. No drama. In fact no acting. It's a waste of time.
1,I didn't really expect much from this movie but was very pleased with the story.  Great flick!
1,Love the series and I wish they would bring it back!
1,Really great action packed series
1,"Incredibly disturbing, but I couldn't stop watching, and want to watch it again."
1,"A little more out there than the first year, but still complex, intense, swift storytelling...."
1,Can't wait for more!!!!!!!!
1,Our grandsons love the minions and watched it twice - can't wait to see The Minion movie!
0,Horrible.
1,Not as good as the original Mr. Rogers but this spinoff is definitely worth watching. They have some very catchy tunes that help kids learn simple life concepts/ways to manage life's &#34;problems&#34; ~ I have a 4 and a 2 year old and they both love it!
0,This had NOTHING to do with what Will thought of his mother. There is a brief comment at the beginning in which Will and Kat give a comment about Diana. The entire thing was coverage from the media of Diana.
1,One of the best shows I've seen. The stars are perfect! I was disappointed that they only had 6 episodes.. They better get a season 2 of this show and make it a longer season too!
0,ScarJo is terrible in this nonsensical movie. It's super predictable and completely not worth the $10 bucks I spent on it.
1,My 4 year old loves this show!
1,"As life goes by, sound like another  ???"
1,The plots are intriguing!
1,Entertains
0,"I wanted to watch this movie to see some more of Jamie Dornan's acting. I think he's a strong actor but this was not a strong project. The part about the pigeons was enlightening in explaining the fascination with them, but the plot around the pigeons just wasn't present enough. This was basically a lackluster film for him. That explains why it went straight to DVD releases earlier this year (2015) ahead of 50 Shades... I do look forward to his other movies coming up..."
1,"My 2 year old watching this everyday. It is one of the few shows that doesn't drive me crazy and it teaches her a lot. She knows how to count so well and even knows some shapes that I couldn't even identify. Pretty sure this is going to be her birthday theme, it is her favorite."
1,Classic
1,The best show ever
0,"I was not a Herzog fan before this film, and certainly not after."
1,Fun movie but I wanted to learn more about wine.
1,"What a wonderful surprise for his wife.  As Richard Gere seeks to bring a little excitement into his life, he brings joy to his whole family."
1,Can't wait for season 4 to show.
1,brought me back to my childhood
1,Wonderful show. Love it.
1,Awesome.
1,Awesome Movie!
1,A classic.
1,Good!
1,Favorite show off all time.
1,What happens next? Please pick this show up!
0,I don't  know where to begin.  I fell asleep 20min. into it. It just didn't seem to hold my attention even with the sophisticated special effects and/or Megan Fox.
1,"This one of the greatest outdoor shows I have ever seen, it is good for the whole family, just clean family fun!  The Scenery and fishing was incredible!  Hope to get to Alaska one day to try my hand at some of this fly fishing!  Everyone enjoy!"
1,Super series ... writing & acting.
1,loved it
1,"A few nice nods to past Star Trek movies. With this series being in an alternate reality, it allows for some good twists to familiar plot lines."
1,Great family movie
1,great show
1,Enjoy the series.
1,It was funnier then i was expecting !!
1,Very funny
1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THISMOVIE.  Jack Lemmon, James Garner, and Dan Ackroyd at their best."
1,Kids loved it. Are starting from the beginning and rewatching the series. Quote the characters.
0,Has a lot of religious slanders.
1,This is one of my all time favourite movies...
0,Debra Messing looked dowdy.. Needed wardrobe attention and hairdressing .  I like the others in the show
1,Parallels our current state of affairs.  Sad but True.
1,Not your typical mysteries.  Very enjoyable!
1,I think it would be a good series. The characters were interesting and the pilot flowed.
1,I found it a little boring.
1,Great watch
1,The story & acting in this sexy spy drama will bring you to the table. The cinematography with the music of the 80s will make you stay for dessert.
1,"Great movie, picked up where it left off"
1,Louis C.K. is easily one of the funniest comedians of our time.
1,great
1,Great storyline. Can't wait for sequel.
1,I love this movie.  Tear jerking without being sappy.  The characters are wonderful and believable.  This movie will touch the heart of anyone who has searched for a love one or who wants to learn more about their past.  A great and unforgettable movie !
1,Great movie full of laughter and energy my granddaughter love it
1,My daughter loves this show and has watch it over and over again. I hope a new season will come out soon so we can find something new with Fig and his friends.
1,"Very good film featuring wizards, orcs, a dwarf, a few elves, some hobbits, and men."
0,"Seemed very predictable, very easy to guess what would happen."
1,"Hoffman is fantastic, he inhabits the being Gunter Bachmann, you feel the ash fall off his cigarettes into your lap. The story is about footwork and deliberation, the thought and control behind building a case and solving a problem. Don't look for flash harry gun fights, this about espionage and the chase. Annabel Richter (Rachel McAdams) is a very convincing innocent from a privileged background who pours her energy in protecting her tortured client, Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin). That's enough, just watch it, NOW."
1,"Lots of character development and good stories. If you like the Star Trek universe, this is a must watch."
1,"Who says money and power corrupt? Martha Ivers does...or at least she implies it by most everything she does. This film-noir movie is not fast paced, but then again neither is ultimate evil!"
1,Was ok
1,"great drama. great ending . an ending that made some sense for a change. It kind of kept you guessing as to what the end would be , but in this cause it surprised me."
0,Worst season
1,"My girls love it.  However, as a parent it can get quite annoying, as with any children's show."
1,"Wasn't the best of stories, but it was believable."
1,not bad......
1,Realistic and entertaining.
1,Great series!
1,It was somewhat slow.
1,"Extremely fun family movie. Maybe not quite as good as the first,  but lots of laughs for everyone,  and you don't feel like you wasted your time watching it."
1,Perfect for little kiddos. No politics involved...  Perfect!
1,I enjoy this series because I believe that it is well acted however I really don't like the characters except perhaps for the &#34;father&#34;. He is probably the least dysfunctional of all of them.
1,Enjoyable movie
1,My wife and I love inTreatment! Hate there's only three seasons.
1,This is interesting and a must watch. It's very  sad how he never made it to his homeland.
1,Great show.
1,That Damn Robert Mitchum  What a Huk Huk  of burning Love
1,It was not for my age!
1,Top notch series!
1,All around great series.
0,Pretty weak overall. Biased against Steve Hackett and the so-called journalist were more interested in getting themselves on camera than actually digging into the history of the band.
1,Steve Carell is an all around great actor.<br />It also helps when you have a great cast to back you in a movie such as this one. So I give it four stars.
1,We have very much enjoyed the series; particularly the lead characters.
1,"I like the epic nature of the movie. The music and the scenery are enough to give the movie high marks in my opinion. Throw in the exceptional acting of Meryl Streep, Robert Redford and the rest of the cast and it's a movie well worth watching in spite of any other flaws. I guess it's not perfect but it isn't a long way off. I wish I could visit  Kenya."
1,I absolutely hate this movie I do not find it funny at all. The quality of the movie is great. No scratches nor does it skips. Definitely not a boot legged movie. Good product besides the acting :)
1,Watched with great niece and we both enjoyed it.
1,My 1 year old likes it so it must be good!
1,My 4y old love it.
1,My kind of humor! honest and bold - and a bit graphic!
1,Oly watched first few episodes.  Entertaining but nothing surprising or new- too much a Hollywood formula- director takes no risks
1,Fabulous acting and storyline.  Loved it!
1,Fricken bad ass prison series. Was good back in the day. Good now.
1,It is entertaining. Popcorn flick. Do not expect high art here...
1,Loved it.
1,What a lovely movie - Blake Lively is radiant & the story is enchanting!
1,ok
1,Was very interesting and held my attention.
1,"Well written, funny, smart.  Can't wait for season two."
1,"Fantastic show. Well written, acted and directed. It's a fun buddy mystery show with great character development."
0,Loved the first couple of seasons. Story lines have become convoluted and improbable. Very disappointing.
1,Nothing is funnier!
1,Awesome movie
1,Pretty good movie
1,it was fuuny
1,fun
1,cute songs and messages
1,Awesome fun! Satire ahead of its time...
1,The actors are good in their roles and the chemistry seems good among them.  Holds our interest and can't wait for the next episode.  Love the obnoxious attitudes of the characters.  Really like that there is drama without the gory crime scenes.  Keep 'em coming.
1,love it
1,Loved it
1,"Odd story, unexpected twist of an ending.  William Macy excels, the rest of the cast is very good, creating believable characters. I'm sure I'll watch it again."
1,I like it. Dwayne Johnson is fun to watch in his different roles.
1,Excellent acting and historically interesting story!
1,Good women flick
1,"Cute, but short."
1,Denzel is the baddest of the bad asses
1,Great experience watching my children enjoy the movie!
1,These are always fun to watch - even after all the years between then and now.  The only thing I would ask of Amazon is to show ALL of the episodes in each season.  There are some missing from the collection that define the series.  Great to have them on here regardless!
1,"I can't even begin to describe how awesome this season was.  Ozzy, Penner, and Parvati -- all characters that get invited back again and again for great reasons.  This season was quite an awesome one to watch, almost 8 years after it was aired."
0,It's a very slow movie. I almost fell asleep.
1,"How can you not love this movie? It is a great classic. A lot of fun with NBA players, and Michael Jordan is excellent! I love the part when Michael gives the Looney Tunes that special water to enhance their performance but it is just plain water. Placebo effect at its finest. Brings back childhood memories."
1,Excellent
1,"I loved it!!  A bit slow at first, but Joan Plowrights character quickly grabs you. Beautiful story, very well told and acted. Following seeing this, I bought the DVD and had it sent to my sister."
1,Love it!!!!!!!
0,Meh
0,FUN TO WATCH BUT NONE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS DEVELOP TO A POINT OF BEING EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.
1,"Joe Swanberg is changing the face of American independent cinema. In a matter of ten years, heâ€™s managed to direct eighteen feature films (including his latest â€œDigging For Fireâ€). Most of these have been made completely outside of the studio-system, being financed through credit cards and actors donating their time. Theyâ€™re purely improvisational, with Swanbergâ€™s only tool being an outline that heâ€™s authored. The actors, in turn, must completely inhabit their characters to the point of knowing what they might say or even do. â€œDigging For Fireâ€, which is undoubtedly his most star-studded film to date, takes this to a whole new level. Veterans such as Sam Elliott and Judith Light are sharing the screen with younger actors like Jake Johnson and Rosemarie DeWitt.<br /><br />The latter couple playing a husband and wife who, after finding a rusted gun and apparent human bone in the backyard of a house theyâ€™re staying in, are lead on separate adventures over the course of one weekend. The husband - obviously more curious about what else he might find - invites a group of his long-time friends to drink a few beers and dig up the truth. Meanwhile, his wife takes their son to visit her parents and get away from some of the marital stresses sheâ€™s facing.<br /><br />Itâ€™s this wonderfully odd comedy/mystery thatâ€™s entirely propelled by the connection between the actors and the director. Thereâ€™s an evident trust between the two, and the movie is infinitely better for that. Not to mention the fact that itâ€™s just a lot of fun to watch. The varied cast works together beautifully (some of the others include Orlando Bloom, Anna Kendrick, and Sam Rockwell) and the story unfolds in a charming and clever fashion. Definitely give Swanbergâ€™s latest film a look. He has a long and storied career ahead of him."
1,Hope there is more coming - great story.
0,To old westernish for our liking
1,"Love the show! Brings some interesting possibilities to today's and yesterday's headlines. Also raises some real issues within the news industry. My only wish is they would clean up the language. My wife will not watch it with my due to &#34;sensitive ears&#34;. I understand this is how people communicate now days, but I do not understand how using the &#34;f&#34; word and abusing my Lord's name adds to the movie."
1,"The title is a little misleading in that the first half deals with Bismark's development and quick dispatch of Hood and the second half focuses on the Allied effort to track and destroy Bismark.  It is interesting in that it shows how new technologies make even very powerful ships incredibly vulnerable.  It also shows how a lone ship, no matter how formidable, is powerless against a vast array of foes who hunt it as hyenas hunt elephant calves.  One is reminded of the Yamato's fate in the Pacific."
1,"Intriguing and very well done, I was fascinated with this show and couldn't wait to watch them all.  It has a wonderfully talented cast and is a clever and well written script -- neat twists and an actual point!  I am so glad I found it to watch and recommend it for people who want to sink their teeth into quality programming."
1,Very funny show. Type of show you would like would be just awful but it works for some reason.
1,"Good shoot them up series, however the politically correct crap inserted is annoying."
0,Lame
0,"Put me to sleep. But then again, I was sleep deprived."
1,I love Dual Survival! I hope they will start a new season.
1,I grew up with this show playing in the background as my parents enjoyed the play. This show runs through many years and stands up across time ans space. Rod Sterling was a gifted artist and a great sense of humor. A wonderful eccentric man with a wonderful gift thankfully he shared with us all. I'm looking forward to watching all the seasons thru Amazon prime.
1,I am not much of a movie person. It is something my wife enjoys. But I did watch this one and was entertained. It was our first stream from Amazon Prime Fire TV. I do have issues with the audio. I needed to turn the volume of my TV up into the 70's to hear it.
1,"I really enjoyed this movie.  There is a good, solid Christian message in there-even though my 34-year marriage is great, this movie made me pause and think about it, and how I could make it even better.  There were some intense, nail-biting action scenes which made the movie even more enjoyable.  On top of all that, it has Kirk Cameron in it-I just love him and think he is a terrific actor.  It really impresses me that he sticks to his faith and stars in Christian movies instead of going the Hollywood route and taking anything he can for exposure to the public.  If you are addicted to the Hollywood blockbusters with outlandish plots, you may not enjoy this.  But if you are looking for a solid, faith-based, down-to-earth movie, please watch this-I highly recommend it!!"
1,"Smart-ass dialogue, quirky characters, running jokes (&#34;did the President call?), and general fast-paced mayhem make this a must-watch show."
0,Awful
0,It's bad. It's old. It's all over the place.
1,This is one if the best shows I have seen in a while!! Excellent casting!!!
1,Very good movie!
1,"Love it. Very entertaining and pulls you in two directions at once.  You want to root for the Russians, but they're the bad guys and you want to see the US win. Very interesting storyline especially for anyone who lived in that era."
1,Great show!! Fast paced......lol!
1,This season is amazing so many oh my god moments and the sunmer finally?? Holy s***! I loved this season can't wait for more
0,I just don't understand how this is a comedy Not funny; more maudlin.
1,"Interesting setting and good writing, acting is ok and fair character development."
1,Have read the books and am enjoying the series.
1,loved it! will continue watching.
1,Great Cops and Family tv series!
1,Very intriguing!!! Can't wait for season 3
0,"The acting leaves much to be desired. When a classmate is murdered, no one appears the least bit traumatized. I get that it's a teen show, but how about we actually make the teens SOUND like teens? And maybe do a more thorough job vetting through the auditions. I gave it two stars because there are suspenseful parts, you just have to put up with teens being ridiculously melodramatic while simultaneously utilizing a vocabulary that most teenagers (especially this sort) wouldn't be able to comprehend."
1,i wish season 3 was available to prime members without charge.
1,"Fun family movie, with a very cute alien :-)"
1,Excellent writing and acting.  If you like slightly raunchy humor in a Rom-Com this is for you.
0,Not a drama.  More of a documentary.
0,"Poorly written, directed and acted. Some explosions, gunfire, care chases and robot fighting action mixed in to a sub-par action movie. As a true transformer fan I found this movie very disappointing and its a tribute to Mr. Bay's grandiose style action, mushy dialogue and missing plot points."
1,A classic B movie
1,Really good storyline!
0,Very slow movie.  Acting was marginal. Also very predictable.  Vanessa Hudgens was awful in it as well.
0,Just weak. I don't know what else to say.
1,When does season two come out for access?
1,"Great show, my family enjoy it very much."
1,"the books are so much better! I believe the performance of certain characters and that they strayed from the book a bit, provided it's lackluster!"
1,Awesome show
1,"This movie was good but a little slow at times, but it had a completely different take on zombies which was refreshing. It's more about the bond between a father and daughter and how far you would go to keep them safe."
1,Very good. Keeps you interested in several story lines at once
0,Cheesy!
1,"This movie is so deep that most people will be frustrated and confused . Like most of Johnny Depp's work it has multiple levels; here you have a basic retelling of the origin story of The Lone Ranger plus the plight of the American Indians at the hands of the Robber Barons. All while a grief crazed Tonto and his dead raven have you rolling on the floor. Action scenes are amazing , funny, and brutal all at the same time.<br /><br />Then it gets strange! Depp Strange ! Tonto is a Windego Hunter and Silver the Spirit Horse is even crazier than the dead raven.<br />Be prepared to Love it, Hate it, or possibly both at the same time. Another Cult Classic for the Deppster and even more disturbing than &#34;The Ninth Gate.&#34;"
1,love this show
1,Classic cheesy Seagal! Gotta Love it!
1,Great cast

1,Had a great time laughing!
1,Great script and acting!
1,Wonderful movie
1,Based on true story and very interesting. Wonder how they managed to succeed despite difficulties and strangers to each other.
1,"I enjoyed the story, characters and the tone"
1,"Great show!! Actors, storylines, all of it!!"
1,This is my 5 year old's favorite show. I just wish it was included with Amazon Prime!
0,"Poor documentary, not offer anything new or interesting."

1,Good movie but should stream on Amazon Prime
1,Best movie ever.  I cry every time.
0,Just ok
1,Super innocent FUN!!!
1,Loved every episode!
1,Best action series ever.
1,Interesting movie.
1,"Great show if you understand it. Not for everyone. Well acted and great story line, you need to get some of the hacking world to understand what is going on."
0,"One of the worst scifi/fantasy movie I have seen in recent times. Bad acting, sense less plot."
1,"Funny, entertaining - love it!"
1,Factual but fun movie.
1,Still funny after all these years.
1,Very good exciting show
1,It was ok. I kept forgetting it was on and forgot to watch a couple of episodes. It didn't seem to grab me like most shows with these three hosts are in.
1,Very well done examination of the science. Exceptional program.
1,Love it
0,I did hot care for..
1,Great special fx.
1,ðŸ˜Š
0,Very disappointed. Did not like this movie at all.
1,Every American should watch this!
1,Great cast. Snappy writing. Tense plot. Fun guests.
1,good movie.  I really didn't know much about him.  I was in high school and college when some of this happened.  So I didn't know anything current then.
1,"The story, cast and acting were great but the movie was a bit long, and the theory behind the time & space was not explained well. I also had a hard time with the audio- the sound effects were too loud but then the dialogue too low I had to constantly adjust the volume. If you miss a piece of dialogue in this movie you will be lost."
1,Love this show.
1,Love this series!
1,We are enjoying this series.  We don't have cable so look to other sources for shows to watch.
1,"I'm a big fan of SciFi and enjoyed this season with some small exceptions.  No spoilers here folks...  First, I find it difficult to believe that a trained astronaut and scientist would consistently be so hysterical and lacking in methodical reasoning and approach to the unknown.<br /><br />Pros: Interesting writing that includes several interesting back stories that I'm sure will continue to grow and influence the main storyline.<br /><br />Cons: Halle Berry's character is inconsistent and seems fraught with emotionally unreasoning reactions to situations with &#34;Ah-Ha&#34; moments of epiphany that I would not find consistent with a well trained and tested astronaut and scientist. I have always found this type of character to be particularly annoying and look forward to their demise over time."
1,Gets better every season
1,GREAT SHOW
1,Fantastic!  Can't wait for the Furioso sequel.
1,DH is full of life and passion.  an inspiring movie.
1,Great movie.
0,Insane. Just mind bending weirdness. This guy needs help.
1,"If you like Matthew McConaughey, you'll like this one. But, I thought the boy who played Ellis stole the show."
1,Excellent!
1,This is a good clean series. Probably one of the best I have seen in s long time. There is little to no cursing and is very well written.
1,"This film, of course, is a classic.  I saw it to prepare me, in a sense, for seeing a stage play of the same story.  It has a fun plot and great acting.  I have to say I enjoyed the movie more than the play."
1,Fun show.
1,Sara is raw in this show and 100% original and no crappy processing or mixing. It is all her voice and in an intimate setting.<br /><br />Very worth watching....and enjoyable.
1,My kid loves this show.  Wish there were more seasons of it.  I thought the show illustrated some very cool ideas on thinking creatively and how to use what you have to solve problems.
1,Good old fashioned entertainment!
1,"No nudity. Realistic account of the undercover workings of anti-terror agencies, the ways terror organizations funnel  money and heartless manner in which they operate. Take your tea or popcorn with you before you sit down to watch because you'll have a hard time disrupting this good movie."
0,This movie was the pitts
1,Sorry when this season was over!
1,great
1,"This show is hilarious. Watch the series and laugh. Then, watch the series again and laugh harder...you won't catch it all the first time."
0,Watched it with the kids and we all lost interest half way .
1,Fun show!
1,Really enjoyable and very New York
1,Great show
1,Didn't like the ending
1,It is entertaining but so far from science that it is not very good quality science fiction. If you like special effects and some drama in strange but unbelievable settings then it is OK. Will probable watch more of the  prime offerings but wouldn't pay to watch it.
1,"Long time ninja turtles fan. Visually, the movie was great. I seen it like 3 times now. But honestly, the story pisses me off every time. Yes the story was changed a bit and that sucked, but they actually chose the cornyer route instead. I can say a lot more, but I'm to lazy to. Shredder was stupid and freakishly too much, the foot are suppose to be silent and ninja, not some mercenary type fools. This movie was setup like a sequel instead of a first."
1,"Good acting, not for me however...."
0,"It was okay. Just getting to look at Colin Firth is worth 2 stars.  Samuel L. Jackson's weakest role yet but maybe he was supposed to be ridiculous and I just didn't get it.  Fight/Gore sequences were too long and I LIKE those kinds of scenes.  Could have used some editing but once Coling Firth was dead, I was no longer invested in wasting time on this film.  I finished but wouldn't watch again."
1,Great movie!!
1,Love this show!!
1,best show ever
1,Just ok..
1,"Captivating, colorful, encourages imagination, friendship, literacy, and problem solving. The music is delightful and the animation is wonderful! Love love love this whimsical show."
1,"What a fantasic series - am so sorry that I've finished it.  Loved, loved, loved it!"
1,"Great movie, great actors. Covers about all of the emotions."
0,See title
1,"Couldn't pull ourselves away, fantastic acting, authentic costumes, mystery, mystique, treachery"
1,I love it.
1,Fantastic series! Love it.
1,It was funny and also touching. Perhaps some of the scenes were too predictable but each episode was engaging. I hope there will be more seasons.
1,Good comedy without a lot of filth.  I enjoyed it
1,Great movie
1,The series is addictive!
1,"&#34;...This is the best thing to wear for today, you understand. Because I don't like women in skirts and the best thing is to wear pantyhose or some pants under a short skirt, I think. Then you have the pants under the skirt and then you can pull the stockings up over the pants underneath the skirt. And you can always take off the skirt and use it as a cape. So I think this is the best costume for today.&#34;"
1,it was a good movie
1,I want more! Season 4 perhaps!!
1,Very good
1,Awesome
1,"Unfortunately contains fewer episodes than previous seasons, but the quality of the stories is unmatched."
1,Lived it. Good fun
1,"Great series, very entertaining."
1,An epic on tape. Soon to be gone so a must to savor it now!
1,"Pretty good.  Not great.  Jim Parsons doesn't do a ton of voice acting, which is probably a good thing because so much of his comedic effect comes from his expressions, gestures, etc., none of which were present in his alien character which rendered it a bit flat.  Same flatness from Rihanna's & J-Lo's characters, but they aren't actors anyway.  Steve Martin was the one exception, he was hilarious as usual."
1,absolutely wonderful...loved the families and docs.  I would love to see more!
1,chars. didn't follow norms. but kept story interesting. ending too neat.
1,"Great movies were made during the time of this productionâ€”without gratuitous sex (or its overtures) and without undue violence. Bogart and Tierney were superb in their roles, and quite touching. I was sad to learn that it was during this production that Miss Tierney (how wonderfully beautiful she was) â€”it was during this time that she began manifesting deep depression which plagued her most of her life. I thought, how utterly sad; but how wonderful (as I read) that Mr. Bogart was such an understanding and benevolent gentleman, who, when needed, often fed Miss Tierney her lines, as she had great difficulty in some scenes. The acting was somewhat understated, which, to me, made the roles all the more to be cherished an lauded in this day of violence, untoward behavior, and everything seemingly disturbed and evil.. I will watch this movie again, and that is how I know that I appreciate a film. Look at the beautiful Tierney and . . . well, I don't know what else to say, except just to see her made the film worthwhile for me. I highly recommend it for those who long for normalcy in film roles and for acting that says what it should say without &#34;grabbing&#34; one by the throat!"
1,My daughter loves this show!
1,nice mix of simple life and humor. great for all ages
1,exactly as promised.
1,Excellent
1,love it!!! great story line great cast car.t wait to see more.
1,Very interesting I enjoyed actors and where it's going am looking for more
1,Great
1,"You wouldn't be reading this review if you weren't interested in shlock karate fighting movies, so I reviewed it with that perspective. The storyline is weak and the main character (Zen) hard to identify with because of the emotional limitations she has. The acting is just OK, maybe better than many similar movies. The reason for watching this movie though IS the fighting, it's great! I loved watching the zany ways that Zen defends herself and sends the bad guys running. If you make it to the end stay for the out-takes, they reveal just how much blood and sweat went into making those great fight scenes for our entertainment."
1,One of the funniest show I've watched in a long time.
1,"I re-watched Veronica Mars from Episode 1 to the end and then the movie.  What a wonderful series it still is. It has held up well.  Its worth the timetpsit and watch binge style  Make some popcorn, grab your favorite beverage-and settle in for well written stories, great characters and a talented cast of characters with great southern california locations.  This round of watching it I realized all the subtle puns and movie references that were laced in the script -made it more fun. Good watch ---go for it."
1,My advice to love the movie is to watch the series.  Still one of my all time faves.
1,"A story we know, but good acting brings the story to life. Love Mirren and Irons together."
1,"Very entertaining, great cast headed up by our old friend Pauline Collins whose movie &#34;Shirley Valentine&#34;, was a great movie from long ago. Great supporting cast as well.  I am looking forward to more of the same."
1,"It seems to have gone off track with Christine and the pods - it's just gotten a bit hokey - I know, I know - it's just fiction - but the first two seasons were so much better."
1,Enjoyed
1,Great plot about prejudice against migrant Hispanic workers. Very timely. Some things do not change.
1,Good movie. A classic.
1,It was alright the original animated one was better. Worth watching once
0,I'm not sure why I'm still even watching this show. It has diverged so far away from the novel it's embarrassing. I don't know how Stephen King even still supports this train wreck.
1,"Absolutely must-see production for any military pilot or Jew, and highly recommended for ANYONE!  Fascinating but difficult to imagine the tremdous and awesome challenges faced by these courageous young men, already veterans of a horrific war, and now inviting a repeat of the same kind of dangerous existence in someone else's bid for sovereignty and security."
1,Great show!
1,Very entertaining.
1,Son loves it! And a bonus is that he is learning to recognize words on his own. He is a little over 2.
0,"Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was the first action movie in a long time to actually bore me.  Lots of other reviewers have said it best the film is too long, has too many explosions with no real point to them, way too much slapstick comedy and no overall story whatsoever.  I still don't get why Shia Labeouf's character is important to the Autobots he is not Albert Einstein or anything.  Megan Fox is basic eye candy but she never gets semi-naked or does anything remotely interesting in the movie.<br /><br />I grew up with the cartoon show and I thought the first Transformers movie was decent.  It had a plausible story and worked for the most part.  This 2nd live action film is a train wreck that never flipping over the whole movie.<br /><br />To me the best Transformers movie to come out is still the cartoon movie which came out in 1986.  Maybe if the live action movies would make a \\""Unicron\\"" aka Death Star transformer it might actual be a good story to film in live action.  Any story is better than what this movie came up with.<br /><br />While watching Transformers Revenge of the Fallen I was thinking of another sequel that came out in the same time period that was downright awful \\""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest\\"".  Both films are follow-ups to decent box office hits, but both sequels are hard to watch and make it through to the end.  I felt the same way watching the pirates sword fight play, as I did watching the transformers fighting it just gets monotonous and boring.  Kind of like the \\""A team\\"" where 10,000 rounds get fired and no one gets injured, hurt, or killed.  You don't buy it as a viewer and just start yawning.<br /><br />The devastator robot was really dumb looking as well.  How come they just did not use the actual 6 construction vehicles from the old TV show paint them lime green and use the CGI to make Devastator look cool like the cartoon version.  With Michael Bay's unlimited budget for this film that would have looked so much betterthan what they came up with.<br /><br />I would rate this film 1 and a half to 2 stars.  It is not worth your time and the human characters will annoy you in no time flat.  Go watch the wonderful cartoon version from 1986 instead.  Half the time and a much better overall movie."
1,"This is a well written, well acted interesting, enjoyable series."
0,Don't waste your time. This is cliche and dumb. But your 5 year old will probably like it.
1,LOVE THIS SHOW
1,Great show
1,Awesome
0,Stupid
1,Cusack and Willis. 2 of my favs. Now I have a third. Enjoyed a new storyline instead of a remake.
1,Worth watching. Hope it can keep the plot going
1,Great show.
1,Great but miss jimmy
1,"Edges over into David Lynch territory.  Surreal Like Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks  This should be another Cult hit like the INK.  I hope it picks up an audience.  Love the two leads, David Carranza and Terry Maulam.  They work well together.  Hope to see more of them in film."
1,"A year and a half ago I left an abusive marriage with the help of a local women's shelter, so I could not watch much of this movie because my experiences were just too recent. I will watch more of it at a later time, when I feel I can handle the emotions. The only thing I would say is that abuse is not always this visible in public. Only in a place where social conventions uphold this type of treatment does it seem like a man would be able to demonstrate his abuse in public (though as one reviewer noted, some do not approve of his behavior). Where conventions have changed, abuse goes on in secret. My heart goes out to Ninah, and to every woman her character represents. It seems like a well made film. I hope other viewers will pardon my writing a review after having only watched a short amount."
1,Great movie.
1,"First of all, I'm obsessed with Orphan Black, so I would never give it less than 5 stars for any of the seasons. BUT...out of all three seasons thus far, season 2 is my least favorite. That's not to say I didn't like it a lot, I just didn't love it. There are some great highlights - including some really great Cophine moments, and some good back-story that you'll be lost in season 3 without.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed if you watch it! Just remember that season 3 brings it all back around and it phenomenal!"
1,"Good show... likeable characters, decent plot.  Addicting to watch."
0,"A cheesy remake of Independence Day, with perhaps of touch of The Road.  If you like this kind of thing and don't mind the lach of creativity, you may well enjoy it."
1,"As a stand-alone movie this was pretty good.  However, if you read the book, the movie takes some liberties which I and my two sons felt were pretty unacceptable.  Thus the 3 rating."
1,Very suspenseful and keeps you wanting to know more.
1,Do you smell what the ROCK is cooking?
1,"incredible actual footage, very sad story."
1,Entertaining.
1,Awesome!
1,A cooking show that actually teaches you how to cook
1,"Fun movie!  Great to watch the senior characters deal with thoughts of love, mortality, and life in India, all while watching wedding jitters from the youngsters. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are a joy to watch."
1,For all of you &#34;non believers/atheists&#34;...I HIGHLY recommend that you watch this movie. For all of you that DO believe in God...this movie will show you how a young freshman man in college teaches his professor and his classmates that GOD IS NOT DEAD! This was a terrific movie!
1,if u like this show then u should check these out  Project Afterlife Season 1  Answered Prayers Season 1  Angels In Disguise  Miracles Around Us  Angels Among Us Season 1  Celebrity Close Calls Season 1  they continue the greatness  great show and stories of faith and answered prayers with acknowledgment and appreciation
1,An absolutely incredible series.
1,"Fantastic writing and acting.  More TV should done this well by writers, actors and directors."
1,Really great movie and we would watch it again.
1,loved it - hoping for a season 2
0,Really disappointing.  Could finish it.  Too painful to watch - and just a great cast.  Such a shame!
1,Kids love it
1,"Clear, great movie"
1,"Surprisingly, at least to me, Jeff Daniels is terrific as the news anchor and anchor of the show.  The tie-in with current events is the most worthwhile part of the plot lines, with the personal relationship stuff being the weakest part.  Pity that someone with the gravitas of Aaron Sorkin feels it necessary to add the sophomoric romantic subplots to what is otherwise adult entertainment.  Similarly, it's disappointing that he turns the female roles into a mostly scatterbrain bunch (except for the few appearances of Jane Fonda who is given a heavyweight role), while the men are fairly emotionally stable.  But still, overall, well done."
1,"Very addictive! I love the costumes, the accents, the scenery, the actors, the story lines.  It definitely takes you away to a different world."
0,Not as good as the book
0,"The premise of the show is interesting and was enough to get me to watch it. My wife and I watched the first 6 episodes and just couldn't take it any more. As others have said, the language and vulgarity is just unnecessary and actually too distracting from the plot of the show. I really wanted to get into it but we just couldn't take it."
1,Kid liked it
1,Loved it. So much fun to watch
1,Nice old family movie
1,"Great plot, Great Actors. Believable, Historical. Addictive"
1,"All movies involve sleight of hand, and this one plays a little fast and loose with some of the science.  But the commitment of the director to getting it as right as possible, fine acting, wonderful evocation of alternate worlds, and especially wading into Einstein's theory of relativity in  popular entertainment add up to a must see."
0,really really boring only lasted 20 minutes and had to turn if off.  why would you make this film
1,Love this series!!!
1,"I thought I would like it as I love the star, but it was too silly for me."
1,Not my favorite Liam Neeson movie.  It was kind of slow for me.  Ed Harris gave a good performance but I think Common stole the show as the hit man.
1,"Love this show, even if it just another soap opera"
1,Funny!
1,inspired to live in a tiny home... I just have to find a way to do it!
1,It was alright
1,"Excellent thrilling movie with a tearing tribute to Paul Walker at the end.  I hope there is a Furious8, but it will be hard to replace Paul.  Thanks for the thrills!!!"
1,"I enjoy the TV series, and have copies of most. I missed this episode which I now have seen. The convenience to watch missed episodes so simply is excellent."
1,"Nice show to get through the Long Hot Summer!<br />It would be nice to see a Season 4 ... Even though we are away from the Stephen King novel, it is a good suspense story all 9n it's own.<br />=^,.^="
1,My family loves this pokemon series.
1,This series is very well written.  All the characters have their quirks but I became very involved with them (whether I liked them or not).  I am 2 episodes from the finale and I'm going to be very sorry when I am done with this series.  It really makes you think about life and death.
1,"They got quite a few very good actors into this turkey, but it still could not fly. Some of Plummer's and Mason's worst work."
1,I would really like to buy the whole season rather than pay $2 a week!
1,Great movie!
1,So cute & fun
1,Great documentary. Well told and photographed.
1,"Excellent old movie.  Shot in Silver Spring, Florida."
1,"One of my favorite moves from the mid-80s. It's light-hearted and never takes itself too seriously, but is so much fun. Great cast, so many quotable lines. Love Lithgow's performance as the crazy alien-possessed scientist."
1,Corny but reminds me of my childhood.
1,Chick flick 0;)
1,The most brilliant show of our time.
1,I loved it. They obviously don't take themselves too seriously. Another fun installment in the series. I look forward to the next one
1,Good kid movie
1,Downton Abbey is absolutely fabulous. I can't say enough about how well it is written and all the wonderful characters there have been in every season.  I really miss the ones that are gone but am glad that the stories and memories go on.  This season was no less enthralling than the first four.  I can't wait for Season 6 in January 2016.  I will be waiting with bated breath for the new twists and turns as well as the growing of the characters.
1,great watch
1,Surprisingly witty and entertaining.
1,"This movie is excellent but neither light or a comedy. It has it's funny moments but centers around suicide, infidelity, depression, etc."
1,Not bad jury is still out have to watch more
1,I read all the Bosch books. This series was just as good . The acting was excellent. I hope there is a second season.
1,Love this show
1,It was okay
1,"Wow! What a great documentary. As a nurse and a mother, I encourage families to watch together. Show your children early the long term issues with alcohol and how a family can still love one another."
1,I could watch this over and over..
1,Good!
1,an excellent series. lots of intrigue plus real monsters. don&#34;t you wonder about some people?
1,"What a great show.  Sorry it only ran for a couple of seasons.  Totally worth watching again.  Awesome acting, writing and stories.  If you liked West Wing, you'll love this. Of course if you hated West Wing, you may not love this show as much as I do."
1,"A spinnoff of Annika Bengtzon, but with a cop instead of a reporter.<br />A wise man once said: Don't be afraid to imitate that which is good."
1,Good show
1,"If you are a fan of the tv series it is well worth the watch, however you may not get some of the plot if your not up to episode 111"
1,Always interesting plots.
1,"I have enjoyed this series from the beginning. I've often wondered how they could go beyond Stephen King's original novel, but they have succeeded at it. Marg Hellenberger is cast perfectly as a creepy villain, willing to literally suck the life blood out of anyone who stands in her way. Her presence has allowed series regular Dean Norris, let's face it, the real star of this show, to not have to be the heavy every week."
1,"I hated for Season 1 to end, so hurry up with Season 2. Every cast member should win an award."
1,Well written and performed.
1,"You have to love Piper Perabo in this role and the writing and character development is great, and there's always lots of suspense in every episode."
0,Not as funny as I thought it would be.<br />ðŸ‘Ž
1,It is a very good program and I think the actors are great .
1,My kids binge watch this all the time. They love it.
1,meh
1,I hope there's another season.
1,"We're starting with Season 1, Episode 1; never watched but will try to catch up."
0,Don't waste your time.
1,Refreshing with a moral to the story.
1,I enjoyed it - seemed realistic - kept my interest --- I recommend it.
1,This season is SO funny! Each episode makes me laugh out loud! Every actor in this show is fantastic!
1,I had to see what happened next.  Excellent series.
1,Love old shows wish for more
1,Never occurred to me this would be a cartoonish movie
0,So there is now nuclear warhead debris floating in orbit?
1,Great movie.. Excellent performance by Claire danes
1,"Subtle cerebral humor that is painfully honest about the life of a two faced military operations contractor and his struggle for self reestablishment. No good story like this would be complete without a mushy romance involved, and bot is there... the only people that would dislike this movie are the same people that give Expendables 3 and Scary Movie 6 a five star review."
1,"Kids love it, I hate it ;)"
1,Pretty good. Not as good as the paper... but a good enjoyable movie.
1,"I loved this show back when it aired originally; it was one of the very few I actually scheduled my time to be able to see when it came on - every week. It is probably the combination of nostalgia and frustration with the current video trash that passes for television, but I still can't get enough of MacGyver! Thanks for making it available!"
1,"I used to watch this show growing up. I is amazing how classic shows can still make us laugh - no sex, no dirty language...just clean humor, great acting and funny bits. Great as a family show, or just a night of relaxing TV while you work on other projects. I love shows like this when I am sewing or painting...just some funny background noise."
1,Good thought provoking movie... Well acted
1,"Yeah, it's one of the movies from the 80's that was cheesy even when it was made, but I love Penelope in the movie.  She's upbeat and interesting the whole of the movie as a protagonist.  Tim Daly is great,and it wouldn't be the same movie without him, but it's between Penelope and Louis Jourdan, the antagonist, for the movie's character.  Most movies are made, for me, within the first few seconds with this movie it's when Penelope goes to Scotland, this is where the upbeat character of the movie is cemented.<br /><br />The plot line is thin, although not implausible; it's the scenery and upbeat story line, with little funny one offs strewn throughout the movie, that makes the movie fun to watch.  This to me is another, 'Better Off Dead' or 'Grosse Point Blank'"
1,Interesting plotl twist.
1,"Excellent, educational programming!"
1,"Well done documentary that provides people who do not consider themselves motorcyclist enthusiasts, like me, an insight into why people are so passionate about them cycles."
0,"For someone who didn't read the book, this movie provided very little entertainment. Characters were shallow and the overall storyline was not very interesting. You just didn't care what happened in the end."
1,"worse than I expected, but still ok"
1,Great season
1,Great movie
1,not as good as seinfeld
1,Funny movie; good price arrived in 3 days.
1,"A classic Eastwood movie, even as he as aged. He can still pull off the leading man tough guy roll."
0,Can't get anything but the first episode.
1,"OK, here is the deal.  I love this show.  But the purpose of this show seems to be to garner audience love and respect for soviet spies in the US.  And make the US intelligence agencies look like a bunch of idiots.  I object to this traitorous slant of the show.  But, for pure entertainment for viewers who can actually think objectively for themselves and not follow media BS ... it is worth the watch."
1,Enjoyed the movie very much
1,Fantastic series. British acting at its best. Oh and Elizabeth McGovern is superb.  I'm almost all ready for the 6th and final season.
1,"It is not a bad series although, like the original &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; it could have used some more science in it's science fiction.  The first season is the best of the two seasons it played, in my opinion.  It does have some good actors and &#34;guest artists&#34; from the British acting community.  It was the most expensive show on the air at that time and it shows in the effects and the sense that you were on the Moon. The premise is a bit shaky but most of Gerry Anderson's shows had shaky premises.  However, there were many fine points in the show with &#34;The Black Sun&#34; probably the best of the lot after the initial episode when the Moon is blasted out of orbit."
1,Quirky fun cartoon - feels like something from Cartoon Network.  My family would love to see this as a series!
1,"I saw these movies in the Swedish version.  This was a little different, but it was also very good.  Great books make good movies."
1,"Very fast pace,  well organized really liked this one."
1,Enjoyed. JS
0,The acting & filming was good .... unfortunately the story line was very weak.
1,Good.
1,My 4 year old loved it!
1,all of these movies are fun to watch
0,"My children love this show. That being said, it's pretty terrible. Even as children shows go, this is especially annoying and not educational at all. Fireman Sam's character is fine, but most of the other characters are irresponsible, whiny and poor examples for children to watch. There are other cartoons out there that are either educational or entertaining (or both), and this show is just not one of them."
1,Compelling!
1,Interesting premise...can't
1,liked it as much as the divergent
1,Very cute!
1,If you have not seen<br />this series in a long time you should definitely watch the first season.  It is even more exciting the second time around.  Every episode makes you want to watch the next one.  Even if you have never seen this drama you will not be disappointed. I am on the 3rd season and it still draws me in.
0,Very good information done in an extremely amateurish presentation.  I am supremely appalled that I paid $2 for this.
1,Great!
1,Funny!!
1,Good series.
1,"This was a wonderful, suspensful,&#34;solve the English Movie&#34; kind of evening..... one I enjoyed very much!!"
1,"Interesting - but takes way too long to get to the punch line.  the ending is worth the wait, but just..."
1,"This is a good story line but the movie is way to slow, it takes forever to get to any of the good parts. Even though there's actually a lot of action, it seems more like a really boring drama. This movie is like a knock off of Steven Kings &#34;Misery&#34; but it can't hold a match to that."
1,Good movie... The end is crap
1,"Really funny, rich characters."
1,"Overall it is not a bad movie but, it is not great either. The voice acting is average and story development is ok."
1,my family love this.
1,excellent
1,"Tim Gunn is my favorite. He's genuine, thoughtful and really helps these ladies learn for themselves what makes them look good. Unfortunately, there are no more seasons :( - more Tim please!!"
1,"I really like Welliver as Hieronymous Bosch (Harry).  He is the typical lonely detective which is central to the plot of the series.  The misunderstood, bad boy(Dirty Harry comes to mind here) cop, which is to say your fundamental movie cop character.  Bosch is detached but he is a romanticist and thus yields a character everyone can relate to.  The plot itself is creepy enough, child serial killer on the loose with Hannibal Lechter escape sequence.  Lance Reddick and Annie Wersching  turn in solid performances.  Bosch is solid cop entertainment and if you're a prime member I can't think of better ways to spend your evening vs searching the never ending list of free prime movies.  All in all this is a class Prime Production product.  Hope to see a second season"
1,Awesome movie well done
1,Hilarious!!
1,What a great series!!!  Looking forward to more seasons.
0,"Animated characters look awesome. Check.<br /><br />Fights were good. Check.<br /><br />Funny? Eh. It's so bad I can't say I didn't notice, but like others say, it's talking turtles, how real or serious do our human actors really need to be for us to sit through it to see our turtles kick ass? *cough* Transformers *cough*.<br /><br />This movie deserves two stars for the animation, but nothing more.<br /><br />DON'T SPEND MONEY FOR IT.<br /><br />1990 Steve Barron version still my favorite forever...!"
1,"Downton Abbey Season 3, like season 1 and 2 is one of the finest series to come from PBS.  We are eagerly  awaiting the sixth and final series beginning  in January, 2016."
1,Intelligent and funny without a lot of foul language!!!
1,Superb!
1,"Let me begin by saying I love any movie or show that has baseball in it.  This isn't really a show about the game, but about one of it's totally disfunctional, narcisistic players who happens to be gifted with a great arm.  Kenny uses every drug known to man to kill the fact that his carreer is over, or is it?  Everytime he does something incredibly self destructive someone is there to save him.<br /><br />This is how VH1 would handle the Kenny Powers story as part of its &#34;Behind the Music&#34; series. Kenny Powers can outdo Johnny Rotten anyday."
1,Very good!  Interesting movie.
1,I love it.  I just paid for season 3.  I understand that is the last season and I am sorry to see it end.
1,What a great documentary.  It was raw and very real.  Is amazing how people could self destruct that way.
1,it was a good watch.
1,My 10-year-old daughter and I have both been enjoying the episodes of Nature. Season 2 is my favorite. We've watched most of the episodes twice because we've enjoyed them so much. I think they're the highest quality nature show anywhere.
1,"It was a fun, scary movie for a quiet Sunday afternoon."
1,it was good
1,Hoping they come out with season 6.
1,Wholesome. My kids love this.
1,BEST SHOW
1,"Silly, but almost non-existant story line. The photography was beautiful, the action was entertaining, and there were some great production numbers."
1,Very interesting to say the least
1,Great watching the second time around
1,I love them all
1,"I'd love to watch this show! Great cast, really well written, interesting characters. This show makes an old, familiar plot seem fresh. Can't wait to see what happens next!"
0,Product kept stalling and it was hard to see due to it kept messing up.
1,"It was fast paced, and entertaining. If you are already framilar with the characters, and story from the comics you will really enjoy it."
1,This show started off slow but interesting during Season 1. I really like Season 2 so far especially since it became sexier. I hope it goes back to the science fiction aspect which is why I started to watch it in first place. I think Ethan is great and of course Halle does an amazing job as Molly Woods.
1,Some of the best acting I have seen in quite some time.
1,Awesome classic.
1,Entertaining
1,"i find this show a bit obtuse, no sympathy for the hero who is a cold fish."
1,Pretty good but  did not like the ending.
1,"As compelling and suspenseful a drama as I have seen in many a year.  Masterful writing, directing, acting and casting.  We are SO looking forward to Season 4!"
0,Stop contacting me NOW.
1,A classic.  Just watched it recently and it's as good as when I watched it as a kid.
0,"Every other word was f@#K. A few maybe, but every other word. Show started all over the place."
1,I love this show!
1,Good series. Not good enough for me to purchase the second season though.
1,This movie is not a masterpiece but it is entertaining and made me laugh. If you are in the need for some escapism = this is a good option.
1,it should of been called Furiana (and in small print (a Mad Max World)  lol  AWESOME MOVIE!!
1,interstingly differnt.
1,"Such a great show. Great cast, great story line, and well... anything that allows me to watch 5 seasons of Idris Elba...is all right with me!"
1,Action packed show with NO commercials.
0,Yawn!
1,Wish I could give it more stars. Pretty pretty pretty good
1,Love syfi - love Christian Bail and Tae Diggs
1,Love it!!
1,awesome man show!
1,"My 4 year old daughter loves this show. I'm glad that amazon has created original, high quality children's programming. Keep up the good work Amazon"
0,"The plot didn't follow the book. It wasn't the worst adaptation I've ever seen, but I was definitely disappointed."
1,"Good..or perhaps &#34;useful&#34;...if you're new to the notion of introspection and coming clean to yourself and the people around you. If you've already acquired that skill---ie, been there, done that, and aware that we all have cosmically &#34;deep feelings&#34;---then it's more of a not-unpleasant trip down memory lane, back to the time(s) of your own awakening(s).  Excellent acting, and pretty engaging...but as other reviewers have noted, shoe-gazing/navel-gazing are great---got to live that &#34;examined life&#34; and all that jazz---but there's more to life than having tea/cookies with one's demons. So, kudos for being thoughtful and well-acted, but a little too familiar and annoying once it starts to sound like whining and look like moping. Gotta get up and keep  movin' down the trail, can't just sit here and feel sorry for ourselves all day!"
1,Great! Would highly recommend.
0,Husband  wanted to watch it!  Neither one of us enjoyed it.
1,"Excellent programs.  Fascinating historically, good drama, superb acting.  The entire series was extremely moving and powerful.  The depiction of life for average people in London during that period, the unbelievable pain and suffering caused by infectious illnesses and trauma, and the level of compassion (and angst) portrayed by the nurses and doctors left an indelible impression.  Several scenes of surgery were quite graphic, which could make some people very squeamish, but they added to the power of the program."
0,I love Benjamin Bratt but this was not a very show at all in my opinion.  The storyline was jerky and very difficult to follow I did not even make through the first episode.  Too bad because Benjamin Bratt is a very good actor this show was not his best effort because of the concept and the writing.
1,It gud show
1,Perfect learning dvd
1,"Love Nova, great for the entire family!  Perfect length of programs, great topic."
1,Mindless action movie. If you don't think too hard it is enjoyable enough.
1,Enjoyed it.
1,Great end to the series!!
1,Great show
1,Wholesome and reality life of how family stays together
1,"Sean Patrick Flanery is a good action star, and this was a story that was written for his character type.  I enjoyed the movie."
1,Great movie
1,Absolutely funny and entertaining ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‚
1,This is a pretty good new take on old school fairy tales.
1,One of my favorite films.  A sweet fable with an arresting soundtrack.  I was especially surprised and gratified to hear Benjamin Britten's music used in parts of this movie.
1,Dome!
1,maybe some makeup to age the cast to make the passage of time more believeable.  men all seem to be dupes of the skeeming women.
1,"Love this show!  String female character and a strong male lead.  Great actors, what else could you ask for?"
0,It was Ok. I didn't expect Kanye West to be good as the commander of the Russian troops but he did a decent job.
1,It helped me to unwind at the end of the day.
1,Needed a better ending but unique movie
1,"I had not seen or heard of this show before i fond it on Amazon. Once you realize where it is coming from, it is really quite entertaining. Have watched most of the first season and am glad to hear that it is renewed for a Season @2"
1,I love everything about that show Stargate Atlantis actually every Stargate show there is ever been is great! If you're into sci-fi!?
1,"Great flick, lots of integrity,  well played by all. Will watch again."
0,Very disappointing movie.
1,Action packed!!!
1,Fun for grandchildren
1,very romantic movie - a total chick flick but so worth it (:
1,It's exciting and wholesome without all the bad language.
1,Awesome
1,awesome movie- great pictures and loads of information
1,I enjoyed this movie. The acting lagged in some areas but the story hooked me.
1,Ammmazing!  I did not know what to expect!  The pilot was very good and I am anxious for September 5!
1,My three year old loves these shows!
1,"I love the Americans, can't recommend it enough!!!"
1,Very funny.
1,Excellent movie.
1,It is a show I'd watch more of
1,LOVE this show!
1,It is fabulous. The writing is terrific and the characters are all wonderful.. We are addicts!
1,Great movie!
1,Just excellent. Have a box of tissue nearby.
1,Very heartwarming!
1,This series is very well done.  I have read all the Bosch novels and the show is as good if not better.
1,I really enjoy this show. Lots of twists and cool creatures. Entertainment at its finest.
0,"Terrible production value, terrible acting, and lame plot."
1,Amazing show! I was born in 1995 and I grow up watching this show every week with my dad!
1,Piper is awesome!
1,"Excellent series.  captures this amazing town's spirit, uniqueness, strengths and weaknesses, it's beauty through music and food and the horror that was sandy and the ineptitude of our political system. A must watch."
1,Great show
1,Love this show can't wait for it to start!
1,"This is great, one of my favorite cartoons of all time!"
1,Thanks
1,"I got exactly what I expected and left the film satisfied. Yes, this is another found film type horror flick. The entirety of the film, minus 5-10 minutes takes place in a skype video chat screen. The topic of cyber bullying is in the spotlight in society and media currently and this film puts a spotlight on it in a new way.<br /><br />The acting was above average for a film of this budget and I found myself actually scared a few times. I have been searching for a horror film that actually caused for pause when turning out the lights at night and this film came close. It won't win any awards, but I got exactly what I hoped for - A fun unique horror experience to enjoy with some friends."
1,PLEASE don't let this one end up like The After!!!
1,Loved it!
0,Most annoying show ever created. T pi u will lose your sanity watching this horrible show with your little one.
1,Classic older film.  Aged well.  Very funny.
0,Just didn't care for it personally.
1,Best tv show!
1,Awesome series!!
1,love it just wish amazon had more free barney movies like netflicks
1,"outstanding script,have watch to and listen carefully or you will miss the the quips"
1,Enjoyable if somewhat unrealistic.
1,Awesome!!
1,funny
1,Brilliant!
1,Great vid to get you in the mood for paddle boarding. Lots of insightful history to contextualize what is sometimes considered a &#34;new&#34; way of experiencing the water.
1,Fascinating story and well played.  I wasn't ready for it to end.
1,"Loved this series. Big names, great story."
1,Enjoyed the show.
1,Non stop excitement  Very attractive stars and interesting plot
1,Excellent series!
1,I'm a sci-fi fan... really enjoying this series!
1,It was a great season that kept you guessing at what was going to happen next!!!
1,I love this show!
1,This movie was hilarious I loved it.
1,"I personally loved this movie, and can't wait to watch the third!! But here is a dislaimer, for those that want to watch the movie in the hopes that it's like the original book, it's not. That doesn't mean it's bad, but like the walking dead and it's paralell universe (the one in the original comics and the one onscreen) this movie is different. This movie brings in some character's and events that further tie the Hobbit to the first trilogy, and appeals to those viewers that watched the fisrt trilogy but didn't read the books. Lover's of the Lord of the Rings trilogies will see some familiar faces and places while also meeting some very intresting new ones. I thought this movie was full of heart, story, adventure and it had more action than the first. The villans are fun, the movie is well paced and as always the music, well it's awseome."
1,"I watched this once on my own, and then the second time with my children. The cinematography is breathtaking, the storyline is a marvelous introduction to Mali culture and the kinder/gentler side of Islam (a possible eye-opener for Americans whose knowledge of West Africa is limited to what they hear and see on the evening news), and the music is absolutely wonderful. (Spoilers: the ending is not for sensitive children.)"
1,"Not as good as the first one, but kept me guessing."
1,Awesome
1,"An artful, delicious exploration of human emotion and the need for someone to explore ad write of the life of someone that had minor fame, but a large impact on her immediate area of influence.  I will watch this over and over again!"
1,slow at first  but got better
1,"I really enjoyed this series. Great acting, amazing sets. Not exactly historically accurate but very good nonetheless."
1,Halle Berry deserves the highest honors for this movie. Wow I was totally blown away. Yeah this is one of her best yet!
1,Love this show.  So we'll written. Fantastic actors!
1,really well done.  funny.  great cinematography.  would even watch again!
1,Good story about the lives of the war and how people were willing to take a chance for life.
1,My kids love watching it over and over. Excellent animation quality.
0,"Got bored,didn' t finish it"
1,Sweet movie nice flix on a quite  evening to unwind .
1,Larry David is a genius and in some ways this show is even funnier than Seinfeld (and I loved Seinfeld). This is the most unusual and strange idea for a series:  a kind of pseudo reality show about his own life: how a very wealthy writer who could disappear to a Caribbean island forever if he wanted instead leads a somewhat normal celebrity life in Los Angeles. He can't seem to keep his foot out of his mouth for five seconds and all of his good intentions seem bent on destroying every relationship he's ever had (or ever will have). Very funny. My kind of show.
1,Great!
1,Pretty cool and sad movie. Loved it
1,Touching and funny - terrific performances.
1,"Good show, one of my favorites on Amazon."
1,What a beautiful star you are RobertðŸ˜‡<br />Without so much as one word spoken this actor showed that he still has it and definitely has that brass ring in his grasp for a possible Oscar. Beautiful!
1,"Excellent TV ,far above average."
1,AWESOME
1,It was ok.
1,"excellent film , much better than I thought  it was going to be.  It was very thought provoking . I would see it again.."
1,My daughter really liked this season. So no complaints here.
1,"It has its moments that tap into that &#34;wouldn't that be cool&#34; aspect of traditional Bond and modern Bourne spy thrillers, but there are some rather bizarre and Tarantino-esque scenes of excessive violence and ridiculous plot points that tank the film towards the end."
1,My Jr II enjoyed it. :-) YMMV
0,Too many subliminal Satanic messages for this to get a good rating. The story line is your typical &#34;why-time-travel-is-a-terrible-idea&#34; story with a British type-cast. It's like what would happen if Back to the Future had a baby with The Antiques Road Show.
1,"Honestly, if it weren't for the lady in the lake, I would recommend this movie to every and five star it in an instant. Absolutely love the creativity and story-telling! Truly a unique film and much worth a watch!"
1,A funny movie that was better than I thought it was going to be. I would watch it again.
1,Much funnier then I thought it would be interesting how all the stories intertwine
0,Sadly a waste of time and money. Terrible sound and the acting is even worse.
1,Great movie
1,"My son liked this movie, I didn't watch it because I rented it for him."
1,Fun.
1,"Fell asleep during this one as well, seemed to be a lot gun fire while i was dozing off."
0,-cheesy<br />-feels like an mtv adaptation of a zombie show<br />-angsty teen drama<br />-i don't care about any of the characters<br />-there's no tension without caring for the characters. Additionally we all know what happens with the zombies already so you're just waiting to get past stuff that we've been introduced to already in the original show.<br />-these teens are in their 30's... i'm sure there are believable child actors in the LA area that could have been hired.
1,"Cute film. My toddler loved it. I'm not going re-watch it fifty times over, but it was entertaining . . . And free!"
1,"If you love Rush, you'll love this. What a great band!"
1,Enjoy it
1,Just see i!. Tatiana is also awesome as the younger Maria Altmann to  Helen Mirren's older one in &#34;Woman in Gold&#34;.
1,"1st movie slow but interesting, last movie interesting but slow. I liked it!"
1,Very good
1,Very informative!! Thank you
1,"A  little tough and slow, not a fast mover, and not great scenery."
1,Grandkids love this movie!!
1,"If you like Christopher Guest's improv-style movies (This Is Spinal Tap, Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, etc.), BBC television, and aren't too squeamish when it comes to R-rated content (really bad language, implied sex, and...I seem to recall there was some nudity, although only one scene), you're probably going to LOVE Family Tree. The characters are hilarious, and strangely Guest managed to include many of his favorite actors, including Michael McKean, Fred Willard, and, of course, Christopher Guest himself.<br /><br />Chris O'Dowd (from The IT Crowd) plays an Irishman from an English family who starts searching for his family roots after his late aunt leaves him a box of junk that turns out to be full of clues about his family's history. Eventually his quest leads him to California where he discovers a bunch of distant and strange relatives. The series ends unexpectedly with the main character torn between returning home and staying in California. It definitely feels like this show was meant to get a second season, but alas that didn't happen.<br /><br />One thing I love about the series is that the female characters are often funnier than the men. The main character's sister is deeply attached to a monkey puppet with a filthy mouth, and the main character's stepmother... let me just say there's a scene involving her where she isn't seen and you can't even hear her, but she made me laugh so long and hard.<br /><br />The whole thing is shot faux documentary style, which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Christopher Guest's work. In many ways, it reminds me of the original UK version of The Office, but without a drop of meanness. Chris O'Dowd's character has an open heart, and he's more than willing to embrace anything and everything he discovers about his family, no matter how insane it may be.<br /><br />I loved this show. The only problem I had with it (except for one unnecessary R-rated scene) is that it ended way too soon. It would be great if someone picked it up for a second season. Amazon, are you listening?eat if someone picked it up for a second season. Amazon, are you listening?"
1,"First of all, I have a hot crush on Kate Beckinsale in these movies. She's just too badass and sexy to handle. Great entertainment. Action packed modern twist on vampire and werewolf competition. Enjoy the vampire genre, this one has a more detailed and imaginative back story for the characters. Recommended!"
1,Great to all ages!
1,Good
0,I could not get a grasp on it...I wanted to see Lincoln's childhood bio but was disappointed.  Maybe it is just the B & W format.
1,Awesome
1,Entertaining
1,"A movie watched more than once with my kids, now my grandkids.  That's why I finally bought it instead of renting it!"
1,Loved. It  hope. To. See. Next. Onei
1,Can't wait for the second season!
1,Love this show. More episodes soon please.
1,kids love it
1,"Superb acting cast, costumes and content."
1,"Opened me up to a world of fashion possibilities concerning accessorixing with style.  Extremely informative, inspirational and moving."
1,"Shaun the Sheep Season 4 -- My family loves Shaun the Sheep - family of all ages. It's good, clean, silly fun that entertains and let's us escape and relax for as many episodes as we want to watch, some over and over.  Please do watch Shaun the Sheep - any season."
0,"Talk, talk, talk! This movie never seemed to go anywhere"
1,Funny - love the seasons
1,Excellent series
1,Found it amusing not crazy hilarious as the trailer would lead you to believe.  It gets most stars for being amazingly accurate in today's world. A good feeling movie.
1,"Excellent show by the creator of West Wing. Similar style: fast-moving, quickly cut, highly intelligent dialogue. Hilarious moments juxtaposed with tears running down my face at the end of Amen. And I'm a 64-year-old man raised as a fairly stoic 30-year army brat. Although the anchor is a registered Republican, if you are too you may not like the show - they take a lot of heat, justly deserved, IMHO.<br /><br />Speaking of the cast, this is one of the few shows where I like everybody. So many shows I forgive the acting of 5 cast members because I like 4 of them - or worse. Everybody is very, very good.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended, regardless of your political persuasion really"
1,Would give it a 5 but not sure why the leads changed so abruptly at the end.
1,What I thought was going to be a predictable film about courtroom inadequacies and family grief took a real unforeseen twist. It left me feeling like those great films of the late sixties did--something reflect on well after the film ended. Acting by characters was superb.
1,"Ehh...not my thing, but good writing & great story."
1,Always loved this show and am enjoying the reruns. The acting is so real.  Where do they find these supporting actors?  They look like they come right off of the streets of New York.
1,Great series
1,excellent actual biography .
1,I really liked the characters!
1,"Excellent season with lots of twists and turns.  The end of the series was especially good, and it seemed as if the writers and producers have gotten a new vision for the upcoming season.  I can hardly waith!"
1,"Actually found the double standards disturbing, and the Hepburn / Tracy enactment of patriarchy was sadly off the mark."
1,"Very informative and a hook to look for more articles, books and videos like this.  There are all kinds of gurus on the internet pushing their viewpoints.  I got the impression that these two men, who have lots of credentials, are just telling us their sincere thoughts about the food we eat without sounding like a preacher. Not a slick production.  Lots of opinions out there , I am just looking for intelligent information. Enough to make me stop and consider.  I also want to buy The China Study."
1,Not as good as &#34;The Good Wife&#34; but interesting
1,Very excited after seeing the first episode hope it can carry a candle to the walking dead.
1,Sweet in it's naÃ¯vetÃ© Russian soap opera. As a native Russian I thoroughly enjoyed this little drama series.
1,Excellent.  I saw the play recently and the story was so much the same as the movie.  very good.
0,Only gave it two stars because I love the cast.  The rest is a disaster.
1,Looking  forward....
1,"Great show! It's witty, its fun, and it gives you a chance to flex your pretentious side."
1,Very good series. Hope there are more to follow.
1,Riveting series.  Will be sorry to see it end.
1,Very flat charactors
1,Much of season 2 involves daughter's Christianity discovery and her ultimate Baptism.  The slow pace and story line detracts  from the first season's fast-paced espionage elements. Nevertheless a first rate series
0,"I really like Ethan Hawke, but this movie was strange. I figured it out almost immediately."
1,Loved it!
1,I enjoyed this movie and just watched The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
1,Always new twists. Cannot miss an Episode.
0,"This movie was horrible!! May I have my money back?<br />If I could give 1/4 star, I would."
1,"From the get go, Bosch gets you involved in the character and the plot. Lots of suspense and sly humor with a great cast of characters. The acting has been excellent and believable. Great show!"
0,Except for the first couple of minutes of the movie -  not one exciting thing happened for half the movie. I can't say for the other half because the boredom became unbearable and I had to turn it off.
1,Fantastic!  Beware!  You'll want to watch continuous episodes!
0,To gross!!
0,I wish they had less than a star.  My family didn't make it past the first 30 minutes.
1,"Well done series with great actors and story. A bit bloody and gruesome for those that cannot take that, but there is plenty of story outside of the battles."
1,Good solid story and acting
1,I love the story lines but sometimes the narrative is delivered to quickly
0,The script seemed kind of tired. The acting was more geared towards the 20th century mercenaries then the Ancient warriors. The trials of Hercules were plain with no imagination. If you like the Rock the movie was OK if you're not a fan of the Rock I wouldn't bother watching it
1,"This is a kicked up adult version of that old stand-by program FAME that gets remade every ten years or so.  Love the Big City backdrop, bigger than life characters, and big, bold cast.  And the camera work?  It is seriously wonderful with well-designed lighting.  I highly recommend it and I only wish I had a bigger screen to watch the show on."
1,"Excellent funny, as usual."
1,Good Movie
1,Kitchy noir with a fresh twist. Lots of fun.
1,Great action.....with a dramatic ending.
1,It's a good wholesome family movie. I really enjoyed it.
1,Great Action
1,This is one of the best shows I've ever had the privilege to watch.  My only complaint is that watching these back to back has been burning up my work day :).
1,This entire series was spectacular!
1,"Some humor in it, loved it"
1,"I love this show.<br />The stories are told in the context of psychiatric sessions, and have powerful acting, since there's so many dramatic monologues and interaction involved.  Each patient goes from initial introduction to some sort of resolution of the issues addressed in his/her story, sometimes good and sometimes tragic.  It's possible to learn a lot about psychiatry, and it's engrossing trying to figure out the reasons for the behaviors brought to treatment.<br />I'm also hooked on how the good doctor will ever find happiness, himself.  Like some of his patients, I too am in love with him!!!"
1,This episode was intense in the best way! A much watch. I hope this wasn't the season finale but it sure was good enough to be.
1,Great Movie
1,Hope Season 2 will be on prime.  Very informative and entertaining show.
1,Well done JD is hilarious and always love Ewan very funny overall!
0,Not many likeable people
1,Horror is not usually something I would watch. 'American Horror Story' has great actors and development of characters is excellent.  There are some disturbing subjects covered and I almost stopped watching it because of them.  The plot keeps weaving along with redemption along the way for innocent lives taken which makes the evil smooth out a bit.  I can not stop watching.  VERY WELL DONE !
1,Great show
1,Great performance
1,My daughter and I enjoy Shaun the Sheep very much. Although I can't say it was the best it is still better than many cartoons out there.
1,Jack Beer is a very interesting man.
1,"Great show, but I am partial since I live in Portland!"
1,Good movie.  Hope it encourages other college students to stand for their beliefs.
1,"fun, lighthearted, entertaining.  Great cast-"
1,It's quite good.
1,Loved it! Hurry up with season 2ðŸ˜…
1,Hope to see more seasons.
0,"Never went anywhere.  It was over, and just left a feeling that it never got off the ground.  I wanted to like it.  The actors were o.k.  The female lead is beautiful.  The friend of the male lead is good in his role.  I am always interested in whether we really know if we are asleep or awake.  Perhaps we are dreaming of what is reality and reality is not really like we think it is.  Kinda a Matrix concept rolled in there too.  I like those existential themes.  I just think this movie didn't do it."
1,"to being right in the real action.  Heartfelt honor, love, compassion and fear.  Well done."
1,I never watched this series when it was on tv but i am now and it is really a fun series to watch and it doesn't include the F word in every sentence or in any of the shows.
1,Great
1,Have studied NDEs and related phenomenon for decades...and feel this show does a good job portraying the subject.
1,tho' I'm a senior I like the situations in this series. Good characters
1,A serviceable SQL it has very good moments of commitment from the actors just a very good story arc and emotional content was it wasn't bad
1,Good show
1,Great old movie.
1,Very interesting movie. The French are very progressive when it comes to creating feature films. This feature is a great conversation piece.
0,"just like watching the show- which i loved, but the movie just had no where to go. Love Ari but the boys just were boring"
1,I cannot get enough of this show. I like it better than GoT!
1,Awesome
1,Nice
1,Im giving it a 3 for the message but a 2 for the acting.
0,This was such a disappointment. I really enjoy all of the actors and I think they did the best they could. This was definitely a case of bad writing. The basic story was good but the writing was completely disjointed and very flat. The trailer was great but unfortunately didn't reflect how poor the movie is.
1,:)
1,Charlie Chan is my go to movie for a sleeping pill.  I haven't watched it to the end (except the first time) ever!  I love his films!
0,Story was a bit dark but in an unintelligent way.
1,Looking forward to season 3
1,Really good series. Go story lines and acting is pretty good. Strike Back really keeps your attention.
1,Interesting
1,really enjoy this show
1,"Great story, comedy and  acting"
1,Love this movie!
1,Great show
1,Another Survivor nail biter.  Good season.
1,Sort of predictable.
0,Might have been better if it was more about the characters than about being int the kitchen.
1,It's entertaining and a bit too profane for my taste. The story line begs comparison with Blade Runner as it deals with the presumed mortality of androids. Hugh Jackman makes an eminently hate-able villain and Sigourney Weaver's performance is stunningly two-dimensional.
1,Great series
1,Exciting whity
1,It's awesome.
0,wow
1,One of the best series and storyline available.
1,I love this show. I was sad to see that there was only one episode. I hope they make more soon!
1,I feel I would like to be invited to tea at the abbey. The characters have become friends and I am not ready to wait to see them!
1,Balanced
1,Great show! Cancelled too soon!
0,"I saw all of these stars and read the reviews. This movie I expected to be much better scripted than it was. Forget how boring it was lets just go right to the ending , w. T. Funk???  It just ends. Totally  disappointed."
1,Loved it!
1,"Like too many of the French films selected by Amazon for streaming, this one has a very obvious plot with a lot of gratuitous twists.<br />Predictable and only useful as a way to brush up on listening to spoken French"
1,Good wholesome movie with a good storyline.
1,Great show
0,Burns once again spews his liberal leanings on things political and I find it a distraction and not entertaining.
1,Arresting program. I'm a big fan of Jeff Daniels and I find his character full of surprises. This is a good glimpse &#34;behind the scenes&#34; of TV news and how that intersects with entertainment. Sam Waterston is also a delight.
1,Loved the mystery in the story as well as the cast.
1,Wel written. 9 year old granddaughter loves it!
0,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long while. Expected more from Reese Witherspoon. Avoid at all costs!!!
1,"I'm halfway through Season 5 and it is by far my favorite season.  From the first episode on, it is fantastic!  Jack Bauer gets better and better!"
1,Good but too slow moving
1,Depressing but heartfelt. Some funny parts help to break up the melancholy.
0,not memorable
1,Very enjoyable.  Suprised it wasn't on longer
1,One of these beautiful tiny homes will one day be mine. What an inspirational solution for so many planetary problems! I love the guys too.
1,Awesome show.
1,Gotta LOVE Stallone!
1,My kids (ages3-6) love the show. I like it because I'm always lacking in the art idea department. This gives fun and fairly practical ideas for projects to do with them.
1,Enjoyed the 1st episode. Looks like a good show.
1,I'm a mom of 3 boys... Well they are young men now! Not military but It is my prayer that a little bit of Murphy be in the hearts of each of my boys. My heart goes out to the family. Thank you to all the guys in Murphs unit...truly a band of brothers! Murphy was about his guys first! Special prayers for Murphys mama and daddy.  Thank you for sharing Your Son and all the wonderful memories you had together. It has made me full of gratitude in every way....That phone call to mama just makes me smile!
1,I can't get enough of this show. I love the banter between the two hosts and always love to see whether they choose to love it or list it. Each season just keeps getting better and better.
1,Very good show!!
1,Amazing story. Great acting
1,Very moving documentary about Clark Terry
1,Must have been good when first came out but now dated.
1,It's a good movie.  A little draggy a times. But I really enjoyed it.
1,Great movie! Love the ending! Knees deep arms SPAGHETTI!!!
1,Intelligent and interesting show. It goes beyond good/bad guys into the complexities of situations and I appreciate the reality that sometimes &#34;you can do everything right and it still goes wrong&#34;.  Fascinating show.
1,"This was a great low budget film.  If you don't mind cheap sound and special effects, definitely give this movie a try.  The acting is decent, and though its rather predictable (what movie isn't, really?), its good to see a horror movie that relies on context and environment cues to give the audience the creeps, rather than slash and gore cheap thrills.  If you're looking to pass an hour an a half with a decent movie, check this out."
0,If you're a fan of the original be warned you might not like this.
1,One of the best shows ever.  Gave you guessing until the end!
1,charming entertaining and heartwarming
1,My wife and me LOVE this show!!
1,Excellent movie. My kids love to point out the names of the different video game characters.
1,Good movie
1,Intense thriller
1,"LOVE THE SHOW, BUT THIS SEASON WITH THE INTRO OF THE WOLVES, THE VAMPIRE KING WHO JUST DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT VAMPIRE LAWS, AND SAMS SHAPE SHIFTING FAMILY( MINUS HIS DRUNK, DEAD BEAT DAD) IS AWESOME SO FAR!"
0,Not my kind of movie
1,"This was an incredible series. It was hard understanding the actor's speech with their accents so you have to pay a lot of attention. But it was worth it. My husband likes comedies and I like horror flicks, but this was appealing to both of us. To give you a reference point, we like Hand of God, Orphan Black, and Penny Dreadful."
1,no new surprise or encounters rom all the similiar haunted former asylum films I've seeen  not bad but repetitive
1,"Classic, what more can I say."
1,Interesting flic
1,Great cast and show!!  Love it!
1,Fresh movie
1,Amazing and a great insight into what happen in an atelier
1,"Halle Berry is awesome! The story is a bit odd, but I'm a fan now."
1,So funny!! I love this show!
1,Early Cho.  Love her imitations of her mom and the Korean culture.  She only gets better as years go on in her comedy career.
1,Never a dull moment.
1,"Very witty, very funny, off color.  One of my new favorites.  I can't wait for season 2!"
1,Love this show and can't wait for next series. Good job to all.
1,Wish there could be more like this
1,great story lines and very engaging
1,Love it and my kids love it!

1,"wanted to see this series but was on while I was at work, like it"
1,"Enjoyable, low key movie. A good respite from those &#34;action&#34; movies with their egregious mayhem."
1,Cried and laughed! Bitter sweet movie!
1,one simple word............awesome
1,Not bad.
1,Love this show when it was on years ago.  Very glad it has come out streaming now.  Love all the drama.  Love JR and Pamela.  All around very good TV series.  Wish there were more like it these days.
1,I think that the main character is rather unlikable in that he has too much of a hard edge to him while the cellmate could have pulled it off<br />and that makes the entire idea unbelievable.
1,"Well written, witty, very entertaining"
1,"Solid acting and writing, good action &#34;cop&#34;  show"
1,"I have been an on and off fan of Survivor for years. I didn't realize how many seasons I had missed until I started watching on Amazon Prime. I am  totally caught up now except some of the earlier series are not available. I am looking forward to a new season which should begin soon. It is much better to watch without the continuous interruption of commercials. Thanks, Amazon, for making so many seasons available to Prime members."
1,"I thought that the first episode was great and think that while others believe it was kind of slow, it was the first episode of the series and this is like a prequel to walking dead somewhat. We get to see the beginning of the zombie outbreak"
0,-1 that is
1,Something came up .  Didn't watch it.
1,I'm just glad I found this amazing series.  I love every single episode of this show and every single character is AWESOME!  Can't wait to keep watching.
1,Love all seasons
1,Exciting in a lot of ways.
1,"Very entertaining and the chemistry between the star and his 'love' interest, Callie, is poignant."
1,"I liked it, but it was scary."
1,I am enjoying season one and starting season two. I enjoy this type of series.
1,"Interesting, intriguing and entertaining observations of some insights into many aspects of everyday life."
1,Action packed!
1,"Myself, I can't imagine three women all a sharing a man and getting along. And I think I'm in the majority. I don't think polygamy would really ever work, or it would have long ago. After all man makes all the rules on this plsnnet aND they all b don't hAve multile wives, aND they pribaldy wold if they could. The show is just a fantasy Islas for a nan.  ."
0,"slow moving, good acting a better director and script writer would have helped.. Two great actors wasted on this film."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Based on the television trailers while this film entered theaters, I was expecting this to be a major flop.  When it appeared on Amazon Instant, I thought it would be something entertaining to watch, and maybe poke fun of for a bit.  But I was rapt the entire time.  If anyone had said that you could make complex characters out of the personification of our beloved holidays, I would have said you were crazy, but these folks pulled it off in spades.  An excellent film."
1,"Awesome concept and awesome actors. Love, love, love it and can't wait for more."
1,very cute entertaining movie.
1,One of the best movies I've seen. Very sweet and romantic! Really enjoyed.
1,Great show well constructed and excellent cast.
1,The best!  Iwatched 3 seasons in five days and nights
1,"Ok if you are a die hard Hank fan and can take anything they throw down the pike, just a big shame that the cast a Yankee kind of guy to play old Hank when we got plenty of good ol boys we could of used.  Hank III looks and sounds like his granddad, they could of gone a bit more into it, but Id watch an etch a sketch about Hank if that's all there was.  So I liked it, but why make up the hokey stuff that Hank gave him the car, Hank JR drove that car in high school, he did not give that away.  Plus all the music is like a city version of country music, all the Hank sounds sound like they are sung by Tony Bennet."
1,"A very human story, well written and engaging."
0,"OK plot, lousy acting...."
1,Gene Hackman Roy Schieder great combo and a true storyAnd a added note all the heroin was stolen from the NYPD evidence locker room
1,I have been enjoying watching the past seasons of Survivor.
1,Ridiculously funny
1,"Lots of graphic violence, gratuitous nudity and sex, and viscerally overcooked, just what I need some times."
0,I love the dry ackward humor! ... BUT there is unnecessary sexual content and nudity... Disappointing... I only got threw 3 episodes.
1,Great show!
1,"Excellent acting, script and viewpoint. Some will think it is biased toward a progressive outlook on many issues."
1,"I have a low bar for horror flicks, and I wasn't expecting much from this one. Pleasantly surprised, this is a fun little movie.  Kept me interested the whole 90 or so minutes, pace is good, sense of anxiety steadily ramps up until the end.  I give it a four horror star rating (cuz I rate horror movies on a bell curve)"
1,The fact that this TV series ran for 12 season speaks for itself.
1,Awesome kids love it! Have seen it 4 times!
1,"My kids really enjoyed this film.  I thought the pace might be slow for them, but they stay attentive throughout."
0,The movie was ok- the two actress made it funny and worth watching. Probably not something I would watch again though
1,Dated...but some legitimately funny parts
1,Everything he does is 100% with me. The man is a genius!
1,Love it....very exciting
1,"Equivalent to a satisfying beach read.  James is the appealing ordinary guy, a burned out teacher who decides to save the music program at his school.  The boxing/fighting is brutal, and while James gets beaten up -- happily he emerges the next day, pretty unscathed.  It's tears and cheers and just right for a feel good film when there's nothing but computer generated violent films at the theaters."
1,I absolutely love this show!!
1,pretty good!!
1,I'll be glad when season 6 becomes available free with Prime.
1,A fun silly romantic movie.
1,I hadn't seen this movie in years. Still great and better than the last couple of remakes.
1,"Very enjoyable,  great cast,  no surprise it's still going strong."
1,An interesting and critical documentary about the salmon fisheries of the western United States coastal states. It's a must see the effects our daily living1
1,My 3 year old loves it
0,"Had potential but could not get off the ground. I see what he's getting at, the quirky style...but too much discord / &#34;dissonance&#34; ...lack of cohesion for me. The Coen Bros. and Tarantino can pull off this very thing over and over, and keep it tight. The acting and dialogue are good, but the plot is not so clever ... the funny parts aren't so funny....and it goes on waaaaaaaayyyyy tooooo loooong this way. I was like...&#34;meh---oh-kay, whatever&#34;....after the movie."
1,"Good suspenseful movie. Didn't like the ending, it felt like they ran out of money."
1,Entertaining and suspenseful.
1,Very well done.  Terrific part for Benicio Del Toro.

1,Good show with well thought out plot.

1,Love having these on Amazon!  great that i can see all the seasons.
1,Cozy
1,"You can't go wrong watching a Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams movie. It was  entertaining and fun."
1,"Loved it ,Cooper can act,Rachel Mcadams brings charm to the screen the likes of which Classics are made of."
1,Loved it! Am looking for season two! Is it available?
1,Cute but a little trite
1,Awesome!!
1,It kept me occupied forsure.  Would recommend this show to stimulate your imagination.  Not just syfi; historical references romance suspense kept my interest.
1,Great!
1,excellent story!
1,The first was much better. Story line jumped all over the place
1,Still a great movie! Too bad it isn't HD but so it goes.
1,Childhood favorite! Five stars until they replace Steve.
1,Loved every minute!
1,Wonderful show!  Love the story line!  Actors are great.
1,"Well acted, but story line kind of slow."
1,Mirren is great
0,"I started to watch this series, but quickly lost interest. Interesting story though."
1,Love this show!!!
1,One of the funniest sitcoms.
0,Horrible acting.
1,"This was a great movie becuase I didnt expect some of the same things you normally see in other movies. Im not going to write a whole review which you can always read it else where. Actually I saw part of a scene my father was watching, and I was so excited I was sold (the church scene and more), I stopped watching so I can see the whole thing from start."
1,Hallie Berry!  Questions?<br />Overall good sci-fi plot.  Plausible suspense.  Worth watching.
0,Son enjoys it
0,Don't waste your time
1,Great
1,Spectacular in every way.
1,"Through Season 4 now, and still like it a lot. Many humorous moments among the fascinating artifacts. Will be disappointed when we're done with the seasons."
1,Best yet
1,"Classic movie, great cast which took me back many, many years.  From an era where most movie plots involved the glamour of the big city, this story was realistically based in a small town in the UP, and the movie sets were appropriate.  FYI, the movie is based on a book authored by Robert Travers, a judge better known for his writings about fly fishing.  Hence, the Stewart character's obsession with fishing.<br /><br />Loved seeing Jimmy Steward, Lee Remick, George C. Scott, and Eve Arden in action again."
1,Excellent
1,"Only watched this because my husband wanted to.  Extremely surprised at how much I loved it!  He did too!  Acting was superb!  Storyline held my attention the whole time.  It was slightly hard to follow in the beginning, but became easier and all made sense in the end.  Americans need to watch this film.  So interesting to see what life was like not so long ago in socialist countries.  People left such countries at great personal risk and came to the USA just to escape such oppressive regimes.  I liked the realistic portrayal of this society as the setting for the story of this serial killer.  Well worth the rental fee!!!"
0,"Sucked, they tried to make a junkie look like a princess.. What a wSte"
0,"You know, I actually enjoy many cheesy sci-fi and disaster B movies. Some of them are unintentionally funny and this one was downright hilarious only because it was SOOO bad that we spent the whole time mimicking the characters who ALL seemed to be heavily medicated or at least had IQs below 50. But curiously, there were several scenes and characters that had NO relevance to the story, other scenes that only served to illustrate some cliche profiling sterotypes, and gratuitous flashes of female body parts (the Sharon Stone effect) which were apparently only due to unfortunate camera angles. As for special effects or CGI content ...it was probably the worst I have ever seen. The tsunami was seemingly a Magic Tsunami that didn't actually destroy anything. Instead things just faded and disappeared while the unmoving wave hovered in the background spitting out what looked like puffs of dust. A second grader's cardboard shoebox diorama would have worked better. If I were rating this on the amount of thigh-slapping guffaw laughter it generated, then it would be five stars. But since money would have to be spent to see it, something I would like to get back along with that hour and a half of my life, then I have to go with a one star rating only because I cannot choose negative numbers of stars."
1,Ok
1,It's actually ok.
1,I liked it.
1,"great show, well done"
1,As always very far-fetched mindless entertainment. Enjoyed it quite a bit. Good had a nice tribute to Paul Walker.
1,Amazing show! Titus Welliver is fantastic! Please give us many more seasons!
1,Entertaining
1,Good and touching girl flik
1,"A story is good when it commands your attention without appealing to baser instincts via gratuitous sex, violence, and profanity.  Such is the case with this sweet and touching story about the kind of romance so many wish for,  but never find."
1,My 3 year old loves it!
0,"Enjoyed the different personalities either emerge or erupt, but did not enjoy all the tears which some were for the camera.  Those that were aware fo the camera and postured for it were fake looking.  Some of the relationships are for real and certainly those are the most entertaining.  There was just too much drama for it to seem like it was real.<br /><br />GLS,"
1,"This is definitely my one of my top favorite mini series, Henry Cele brought King Shaka to life."
1,Amazing. Great workplace comedy
1,The first movie was so much better than the second
1,"I started watching it at an earilier date, & it did not get my interest brewing, so I stopped it.  I kept it in mind though, as I thought it would be one worth watching. So just recently, I tried it again. After waiting patiently through the first part of the Movie, it finally got off & running with Action. It had a good climatic ending. It was worth watching once."
1,Wonderful series a must watch
1,Great show. Wonderful next to last episode. Cannot wait for second season.
1,"Bosch is pretty unemotional guy, but you're still rooting for him"
1,I just love how the show always shows almost every step of the process very informative and entertaining.
1,Good
0,"Two hours of my life i shant get back, A dressed up manequin with voiceover would have acted as well as Kristen Stewart, Thankfully her lines were few. the CG and Chris Hemsworth kept the film together as well as they could"
1,"Even more enjoyable than I had thought it might be, definitely worth the watch!"
0,"The story line was fine, but the production, editing, and costumes were awful, and I mean awful.  Even my kids laughed at the obviously stuffed horns on Malificent.  I went to bed early and the kids complained how awful it was, from the music dubbing and dance moves to the bad acting."
0,Waste of time and money
1,Great movie
0,"I liked it better when it was a Western and revolved around Bohannon's life. Then it turned into a drama about the race to build the train. Is the actor playing the Swede paying to appear in the series, his character should have been eliminated about two or three seasons ago."
0,Mediocre plot
1,This should be required viewing for all the Holocaust deniers out there. It is amazing to me that people could be so cruel to other people.
1,greatest sitcom.  all the characters are so funny.  highly recommend it
1,Good action.
1,Well Done !
1,"Very well written, great pace and flow throughout, wonderfully comic bits and characters, but also at times quite intense and moving."
1,I love this season!<br />Keeps getting better every Episode!
1,A bit corny but lots of comic book style action.<br />It's still a fun way to waste a little down time.
1,Daughter loves it and I found it pretty entertaining. Enough to watch it with her.
1,Great series. Love the characters and the plot line.
1,Never disappointing; always intelligent writing and great acting. Oxford is evidently the place to be murdered!
1,Fun addition to the Downton Abbey Series to give you more insight into the time period
1,"This movie is great fun to watch. I was never quite sure if they were trying to make it as campy as it was, or if that just happened through some happy set of accidents. I'll watch it again and again, I'm sure."
1,Awesome show with great characters!  Hard to imagine what people will really act like when the rapture does come.
1,I'm a history buff who never watched baseball on tv. I tried this because it is by Ken Burns. I was enthralled by each segment. Excellent! Fabulous! A Must See! I've watched it at least three times!
1,one of my essential films. the scene at the chinese restaurant between robin williams and amanda plummer is worth the entire price of admission. improvisation at its best. hilarious.
0,Not a fan of this show. Clone Wars much better.
1,I continue to enjoy the twist s and turns.
1,This is one of my top all time sci fi series of all time
1,Fun show to unwind to
1,"My children love it. They are 6,10, and 16. I find it amusing too, so it isn't the usual difficult to sit through kid fare."
1,Smart and inspired writing.  Great for 6 to 10 years old.  Math concepts.
0,.... Previews was the entire movie.  It should be a $0.99 rental.
1,By far one of my favorite Nick Sparks Movies after The Notebook!!
1,"Great scifi series, especially with actors from Grimm and Eureka."
1,Awesome!
1,"Another Opportunity gone by the waysides! This plot, however, never really developed. Like the settlers and their oxen, the story simply plodded along and the ending shows a clear lack of imagination, funding, or both!"
1,"We love this movie!  We have 2 boys ages 2 and 7.  They both love this movie, it's a great story, music is hauntingly beautiful.  It's a good snuggle on the couch at the end of a busy day movie."
0,Boring!!!
1,"Being able to review movies without knowing what you're talking about is just dumb. While trying to tell people what to like and what not to like is idiotic.<br /><br />You have to have a certain taste to appreciate any movie. You wont like it if it isn't your taste. Thats what trailers are for. You shouldn't have watched this film if the trailer didn't appeal to you.<br /><br />To the 1 star reviews.<br /><br />How dare you come here and tell people whats good and what isn't.<br /><br />Thats like telling people what genre music they should listen to.<br /><br />This isn't an appliance review where if it works it gets 4- 5 stars and if it doesn't it should get 1-2.<br /><br />This is an Action movie. Not a drama. Meaning there doesn't have to be an in depth story. Its also the first movie in a modern day trilogy and its not a mad max reboot. Its a continuation. If you had a brain and watched the previous movies, what story did you need or expect exactly?<br /><br />If you gave 1 star for this movie you should delete it because your opinion doesn't matter."
1,Great movie
0,"All the lead did was run, through the whole movie."
1,Love this film.
1,this movie was not what i expected.
1,"i love this series, it even follows history has it was supposed!"
1,I think that these guys give a bad example by smoking weed all the time.
1,Love this show.
1,Tom Hardy makes it worth it.
1,good family movie
1,very entertaining! can't wait for the next season!
1,"Twisted but hilarious with characters that are really well developed and unique. I love the developing relationship between all the main characters, and &#34;George&#34; is a very cute and lovable, albeit somewhat neurotic, teenage girl forced into a very bizarre and frustrating reality."
1,"Nearly sixty years later, this remains a tour de force, an psychologically creepy story underneath a mystery."
1,Totally hooked!
1,Holy moly she's a think bitch
1,Who doesn't love this show?
1,Classic Chevy
1,I loved this show as a child and I still love it as an adult!
1,Good movie!
1,Great series. Wish they would have continued it.Caught it late. Up there with The Wire and The Sopranos.
1,Funny love the discipline techniques!
1,As bad as &#34;Erased&#34; was - this is the opposite!
1,Marie is always good to watch
1,wife says she loved it.
1,Great movie
1,Pretty cool show
1,This show could have gone on for more seasons. The fact that Sam was leaping into others lives was an awesome concept.
1,I have always liked Larry Davis's wit and very humorous situational comedy. I don't think the four letter lingo is necessary but seems to be the current mode of comedy these days. The episodes are entertaining as well as original. Great laughs and acting.
1,my kids and I really enjoyed this movie &#60;3
1,"I didn't finish it, it was just to predictable."
1,"Intelligent exploration of relationships, not just words and pictures but some new words and pictures the characters bring to each other."
1,Excellent TV.
1,well produced and authoritive.
1,"delightful, thought provoking and real"
1,Excellent writing and acting!
1,"An exquisite film, a powerful story, the writing is brilliant and the actors live their parts. Your heart will learn much."
1,"First, I have always been a big U.N.C.L.E. fan all my life from the very first episode which was aired on September 21, 1964.  I was only 9 years old at the time but &#34;the man from U.N.C.L.E&#34; left a lifelong impression on me.  It's one of the driving reasons I went into Law Enforcement.  I collected anything and everything that was U.N.C.L.E related and still have that collection today!<br /><br />So, with all this in mind, here is my take on the movie: If one is expecting to see the show with hopes of re-experiencing our two favorite agents entering the secret entrance to the New York HQ via Del Floria's Tailor Shop you are going to be disappointed!  Because this is NOT the premise of the movie.<br /><br />However, for all the fans that can get into the idea of seeing a prequel on how, Illya Kuryakin, Napoleon Solo and Alexander Waverly first meet (and getting to know a lot more about all their backgrounds); then you are in for a treat!  The movie does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of life in the early 1960â€™s and set stage for a great spy thriller of two agents (one CIA and the other KGB) being forced to work together to prevent an international criminal organization from using a Nuclear bomb to instigate a world crisis. While THURSH is never mentioned by name; we all know who is behind this!<br /><br />The movie is fast paced, full of car chases, plot twists, intrigue, plot twists and even double twists to keep the most avid spy and mystery lover guessing all the way through the end of movie!  You can take nothing for granted and many things and people are not what they seem!  For hardcore U.N.C.L.E. fans your will get to see our beloved â€œU.N.C.L.E Carbine Specialâ€ faithfully reproduced make an appearance in several of the big battle scenes near the end of the movie!<br /><br />Bottom line this is a classic spy/action thriller!  With lots of classic U.N.C.L.E humor thrown in to break the mood when thing get a little too intense!  No spoilers here so you will have to see the nail biting end for yourselves; but it is worth the manicure to get there!!"
0,"man, for how funny the rest of the series is, season 4 is really terrible.  man, i could not even finish it, it was that bad.  it is one thing to attempt to grow a series but the new writers did a terrible job!"
1,"Pretty good! Dustin is good, tiny but good!"
1,Fabulous!
1,Show was great
1,BROSNAN IS ALWAYS RELIABLE!
1,It is ok but seems to be dragging on.
1,great prime option...check it out
1,Great movie with a great story!
1,"First there is no dome.  Then there is a dome again.  Then there is a hive mind takeover causing a split within the factions in town.  Just another set of under the dome episodes - where everyone is goofy, and the government is trying to help out.  This season stretches out the franchise - covering weeks three and four after the mysterious dome suddenly came down over the town of Chesters Mill.  If you are invested in the series, you'll watch it.  But that's about the only reason to."
1,Good show.
1,Great  show
1,ADORE this series.  Brilliant writing...great cast.  Aaron Sorkin is a genius with both plot and dialogue.
1,She's incredible in her roll  great series
1,These types of movies always intrigue me.  I think we don't realize that this does happen.  What good characters and it was a good story.
1,This is a great insight into a great show.
1,Yesssngoood
1,Nice movie

1,Good uplifting story.
1,good.
1,"Good acting ,the time<br />Is set well , based off true events"
1,Great show!
1,"Fantastic show.  Smart, thought provoking drama that is relevant years later.  Daniels gives a fantastic performance and the rest of the cast is top notch."
1,It was good.  Julia Roberts is one of  my favorites.  The plot was cute and ended just as it should have.  Cameron Diaz was delightful.l.
1,"My two kids love this show. We've been seeing this show for years, it is still funny."
1,Wonderful ride of artistic crazy
1,Love this movie. Great for the whole family!
1,Never gets old!
1,Great show.
1,Fun movie for the entire family.  My son loves it and their are great messages for all ages.
0,"What a piece of crap. Ridley Scott is capable of so much better than this. I kept wishing I was watching the Charlton Heston version. As they say, this is $6 and 2 hours and 30 minutes I will never get back."
1,Not deep sci-fi . A bit silly but entertaining enough. 4 or 5 stars for kids.
1,I love the show. Waiting for some new episodes.
1,okay
1,This is one of my favorite movies.. its great and believe it or not ITS CLEAN. :)
1,&#34;Oh I like that!&#34;
1,good acting
1,Best show ever!!!
1,Very sweet and touching love story
1,Great show.  Titus Welliver is perfect for the part of Harry Bosch. Does a great job of bringing Connelly's characters to life.
1,OK
1,OK but a bit dated
0,"What was Dudley Pictures International Corporation of Cuba, S.A.?  The credited production company of this exhausted effort, which was released by Allied Artists to no acclaim on 1957.  It's tempting to think how mob money sluicing through Havana could have been laundered through the ostensible production costs of these and other B-pics made in Cuba just before the Revolution.  At any rate, Dudley ceased to exist after this single effort.  Platinum blonde Burr's salacious stares at the smoldering young Cassavetes in the first half are also intriguing to watch.  There's more heat between these two than with the third side of the triangle, the blonde femme fatale, Miss Sara Shane.  Burr got his first wheelchair role in this, a decade before &#34;Ironside.&#34;  The movie only comes alive when Celia Cruz shows up and everybody goes into their dance."
1,"This movie starts slow but man once it starts, it never stops. Soooo good. Definitely check this one out!!"
1,"While the show itself has a 90's feel to it, it was made in the 90's. I like the realism of this show. Great cast, and great acting. Good show for adults only!"
1,One of my favorites on this subject. Beautifully done!
1,Great movie.  Very realistic.  I really felt the pain of the actors
1,I love this show!
1,"I watch this show with my girlfriend, we love it."
0,I only watched the trailer.  But it looks like it is made for girls.
1,"Jake is a great actor,  Very good movie, interesting story line."
1,Entertaining
0,"Poorly paced, weak character development, just boring.  I was very disappointed because I look forward to Clint Eastwood's work."
1,absolutely amazing season!!
1,"I had high hopes for this one based on the one-of-a-kind movie Inception, but Interstellar just failed to deliver to me what a movie like this should. Mind you, I am a huge fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey, 2010: The Year We Made Contact, and Contact. Interstellar had an overall good storyline and special effects, but Nolan tried to make this movie like Inception and you just can't do that in this type of movie. It becomes convoluted, cheesy and un-credible. Too much time was spent on building the character's relationships, feelings, etc. instead of exploring the mystery of space time. Also, McConaughey was so much better as a supporting actor in Contact, than as a lead in this. He looks so gaunt in this and it seemed like there was just too much on his plate. It's like ever since Dallas Player's Club, the movie industry is trying to suck the acting out of him while he's still in his prime. And the ending, which is supposed to be the 'gotcha' moment, was so quickly wrapped up that I just brushed it off. Interstellar proved more to be like Transformers and Signs rolled into one."
1,I have almost everything Jack Lord. I'm biased. The movie is good but Jack Lord makes it better.
1,Really enjoyed it.
1,Funny
1,Was hooked from the first episode! What an awesome show. Love it!
1,rosario dawson is gorgeous
0,I thought this movie was boring and predictable..  It started out great then just falls apart
1,"As a chess player, I loved it!"
1,"Great show, the development and interaction of every character is extrely well done and it makes the story that much more interesting."
1,Just plain  excellent. ..the photography was exceptional! !!
1,"It's getting a bit goofier. You can tell they're running out of story line. Still, once I start my &#34;evening watch&#34;, I can't stop with fewer than 3 episodes."
1,Nice coming of age movie.
1,"Definitely a new idea,which is rare. You don't see very many original series anymore. This one is."
1,"I have grown up around dogs, from my earliest memory there has always been a dog in my life. I would like to see more films like this one or even a Hollywood production depicting how dogs are used in war. I would have liked to have had more detail about the dogs and the interaction with others as well as the working aspect of each in its own expertise. That said I found this film great as far as it went. It told the story of both the dog and handler, how they were selected and trained. Not every dog, not everyone who wants to be a handler is selected. It takes a special kind of person and a special type of dog to do what this film is about. The film described the daily grind and rewards as well as a few special moments in the lives of the team's. Action wasn't missing, and the bond between dog and handler was clearly depicted. Well worth watching and may watch it again, soon."
1,Light humor...Hard to understand the English accent at first but enjoyable
0,The script.... It's a nonsense... Too many gaps.
1,A must watch
0,"Don't waste your time. This was beyond boring and stupid. Was looking forward to a campy, bad 70's film but this was a real stinker."
1,"I rate it a 4. If  you keep the historical perspective, it is a good historic movie. It could also be gross and disgusting if you let it get to you.<br />I had to watch bits and pieces at a time"
1,Very good movie
0,Was morally offended at the outset; did not watch the bulk of the movie.
0,Killed it before I watched it boring
1,Loved this series!!!
1,"Great stories, fantastic characters, codes and beautiful art. Very funny and adventurous!"
1,Addictive!  Excedllent!
1,It was good but not as good as the first one.
1,"The story does drag on a bit but does have a sad, powerful ending.  It did catch me by surprise.  About halfway through it, I realized that this was on the Sci-Fi Channel recently."
1,The ending was kinda abrupt!
1,Enjoyable
1,"BEST MOVIE, CAN'T GET ENOUGH"
1,"This is a beautiful animated film that is magical! Everything from the animation style, the characters, the soundtrack, and the storyline will hook you. A beautiful nod to Irish fairytales and legends."
1,I really enjoyed this old movie.
1,Shaun rules!  One of the best of the series
1,We truly enjoy this series.
1,"This is an incredible story, I did not know about the Franklin and all that happened on board, its amazing, the will of the men to survive. In my opinion the captain had it all wrong by shaming the men who went off the ship, he was wrong, dead wrong, all these men were real heroes."
1,"For history enthusiasts, just the right blend of historical fact and dramatic re-enactment.  This documentary takes you to the major battlefields of this century-long conflict and gives insight into one of the great events in English history.  Enjoyable and accessible."
1,My toddler loves this cartoon series. I don't think she has learned anything undesirable from Strawberry and her friends. Only cuteness!
1,"Good movie , good for kids"
1,Love everyone of the episodes. Watch them multiple times.
1,My toddler loves dinosaurs and this is a safe way for him to enjoy them without getting scared.
0,far fetched garbage.  The guy is nuts.
1,I loved it great story!!
1,"The perfectly perfect Kate Winslet portrays a widow who must make her living in a metier most often practiced by men, that of landscape design.<br />So naturally, and with little struggle, she's commissioned to add a garden to the palace at Versailles. The plot of this film may be a little thin and probably historians are tearing out their hair over the lack of historical accuracy but, nevertheless, A Little Chaos has great charm and is beautifully filmed. The star performances are evenly low key and several familiar faces seem to have fun in their supporting roles. Alan Rickman, who also directs, may be the calmest Louis XIV ever seen on screen. There ought to be more overt passion, but alas. In any case, I'd recommend A Little Chaos to all. Four stars, for sure, and five stars for the whole look of it, costumes, sets, cinematography."
1,"This is a good series. Takes place in England I think in the early 1960' s. I could be wrong about that!  There is a surprise twist to the story.  Mostly about doctors and nurses, husbands and wives, girlfriends etc."
1,"Good show to pass the time, like the make-up"
1,"Loved this show! Sad that it ended so soon, but I guess there wasn't more they could add..."
1,Love all the  Shaun the sheep series
1,really enjoy this series
1,good movie
1,Story line not exactly as clear as a bell
1,Fun and funny - great stuff
1,So far its an interesting series. Got pulled in from the very first episode.
1,Interesting older flick
1,"I love history, and I thought these programs were very well done."
0,Less than expected
1,interesting
1,Great show
1,Loved it. Atmospheric haunted house movie with good acting.
1,Comedy and romance mixed with suspense and drama.  They are great.
1,outstanding
1,I watched Blues Clues as a child and now my boys get to enjoy it. They love it and we even play Blues a Clues at home. Would highly recommend it.
1,I think this is the best season. You feel the authenticity in their lives and it's relatable. New York as a back drop is cool.
1,it get a little weird but it's fun
1,Funny
1,Felt like it ended rather abruptly after reaching the climax of the story.  Halle always delivers a great performance.
1,"Not bad, good for a casual watch."
1,Great movie!!!!!!
1,not as scary as &#34;The Ring&#34; but not bad for a sequel and Naomi always worth watching.
1,Awesome show hope it lasts longer than most good shows!
1,Adrenalized non stop action!
0,Poor plot with less than acceptable acting.
1,Loved it
1,Pretty well done given the magnitude of the event. British and Poles had the worst of the campaign and they get most of the time in the film.<br /><br />I wonder if they did not show actual footage of the drop? Impressive nonetheless.<br /><br />The campaign was a fiasco and a tragedy. Story tells that pretty well.
0,I really wanted this to be as funny as everyone said
1,Excelent sequel from season 1.  Watched the whole season in 3 days.  Can't get enough of Under the Dome.  Looking forward to season 3.
1,I've watched every episode of Justified and would watch them all again in a heartbeat!  Love this show!
1,A masterpiece.
1,I'm hooked love the show and can't stop watching!!
1,"This is a qwirky movie. But it has some very warm moments and a HEA.  But wouldn't really watch it again. Worth a rent perhaps, but not a buy...to me at least."
1,"Great teen film, that will make you cry. I didn't necessarily think this would be a wonderful story, but I loved the interpersonal dynamics, the heart break of this young girl watching her world crumble and making the crushing decision on to go on without her family to go toward the light that she kept seeing."
1,Great show. Holds your attention. Always an unaccepted action. Great cast.
1,My Great Grand son told me that this was the best.
0,"Liberal Lies.  This started out being hard to figure out as to whether it was really going to be a show that valued integrity and truth, and actually the first couple of episodes we were still believers.  Seeing unannounced Jane Fonda quietly take the scene made us suspicious.  And then before long the bs got deeper and deeper and we quit about a quarter of the way through episode 4 of season 1.  If you drink the koolaid of the cult then this is for you.  It puts a spin on the spin to make it seem like the lies are true. Too bad.... because the acting, dialogue, story line is captivating and well done. Government politically correct propaganda at its best worst!"
1,"If you are a Monty Python, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy Eddie Izzard's Dress to Kill.  IMHO - it is his best stand up show.  &#34;Glorious&#34; runs a close second."
1,This is classic old style batman. It has both hilarious parts as well as things that really make you scratch your head. Really though it is a classic and a whole lot of fun. It is though quite ridiculous
0,"This movie, with a potentially good cast, was extremely disappointing. The story was silly and the actors couldn't redeem it."
1,Love it!
1,"Excellent movie, a must see if you are interested in flying or how Howard Hughes made his fortune."
1,Excellent show / nice to be able to see again after all these years!
1,"Good characters, well defined, and clever references to current politics. Very enjoyable."
1,Pretty good movie. I'll watch it again.
1,C
1,Not as good as season one should have stayed with the same theme as season one.
1,Good
0,I need to watch a few more episodes to give s better review the first one had a lot of violence sex and corruption we will have to see if it holds my attention!
1,Excellent and worth watching more than once.  There is a lot to absorb.
1,Excellent movie. I can honestly say that it more than lived up to the original.
1,Great
1,Great friendship movie!
0,"It's easy to find things to hate about any country or culture; it's especially easy to find things to hate about the USA. The fact that so many Americans are &#34;in on the joke,&#34; and laugh about the absurdity of their own civilization concerns me. This isn't the first movie to raise awareness on a rather serious issue, while at the same time being flippant about its own message. Idiocracy comes to mind. And although God Bless is funny, at times, I feel guilty for finding it so. Here is a movie that highlights and ridicules the most shallow aspects of entertainment in the country, and rather than leave it at that, it devolves into some awful parody of itself by investing in massive amounts of violence. Maybe the director is trying to pander to his audience, who even though they believe themselves to be above the vile figures portrayed, are nothing more than consumers of the very filth railed against in the film. This is hypocrisy at its finest, in other words, and everyone is in on it. Me too, and I hate myself because of that. Having seen the previews before, I started watching the film with some knowledge of the plot. I wanted to sit and watch the mutilation and destruction of things that I see as repugnant. Unfortunately, I became repugnant for indulging in that desire. I haven't felt this dirty watching a flick since Borat.<br /><br />Structurally, God Bless is very well-made. Even if the ending is predictable, you get that feeling as with all good road-trip movies -- you're just along for the ride, no matter the destination. The acting is superb. The only other program I've seen Joel Murray in is Mad Men. He was a decent choice for the disillusioned Frank. And the fantastic Tara Lynne Barr, his sidekick, reminds me of a young Christina Ricci.<br /><br />Be wary of a film that preaches one thing and practices another. Maybe I took its theme a little too seriously. I doubt it. There is something perverse here."
1,The book is always better.
1,"Intriguing Scientifically hidden facts regarding our inner unexplored selfs, and how scientific minds use this information to gain status, power and prestige that accompany it."
1,Very good. We learned a lot.
1,Love the show. The entire family sits down and watches when it's on.
1,Good action and story line.
1,Great document sure. It will open your eyes to elephant abuse.
1,"Very good series pilot, looks great in 4K. Unlike some shows, the streaming 4K video quality, while maybe not the absolute top quality, look really very good and does not look like it was upsampled. Curved edges show no signs of moiree or aliasing, color is good if somewhat dark (the current movie standard). Consult the I-Ching and it will tell you to watch this show. Script is decent, obviously nothing like Philip Dick, somethings are overdone for my taste. The blend of vintage americana is skillfully done, sort of Blade Runner meets Mel's Diner."
1,"Amazing story, amazing musician, amazing human."
1,"Good family movie.  It's fairly long, making it a little tough for kids with a short attention span."
1,Fantastic.  Should not have been cancelled!!!
0,"very much enjoyed the 1st season with the colonel, sad to see her replaced with an annoying person.  like the guys very much, cant see them taking orders from the droop haired, shifty eyed woman.  Hoping to see her bumped off, am looking for future seasons without her, if not, i do not plan to watch"
1,my kid loves sponge bob
1,"a good movie.  not great, not truly exceptional, but well worth watching."
1,"It was pretty good, but a bit repetitive."
1,Very informative and easy to follow video. Will watch again and again to gather more information.
1,"I like that this was an artsy, western, redemption film all rolled in to one. Not what I expected but it was great."
1,Great show!!!
1,Very Good Show
1,Beautiful movie
1,Great show
1,Excellent
1,Fun movie!
1,"Happy, funny, so sad that it was painful. I loved hated it!!!"
0,the same s*** as the part 1 with  a little more gossip
1,I actually like this show as well as my child!
1,"One of the best shows I have ever seen. Season one was magnificent, and season two is nothing short of brilliant."
1,Love it
1,This outstanding entertainment conveys the period with impressive historical detail.
0,Sucks
1,Season 3 is better than season 2 hoping for season 4
0,"Kids have nothing to learn from this cartoon, and it is not entertaining in the least. My children will not be watching this show."
0,I just got back from Hawaii so I was in the mood for a movie that takes place there. Bad decision.  The direction of this movie is a bit bizarre. The characters are unlikable and the story line is a bit confusing and unexplained. Emma's stone character is apparently 1/4 Hawaiian which just isn't believable in my opinion. I would wait and see if it's ever offered with Amazon prime before spending money on it.
0,The idea is good and the actors are doing their best. The suspension of disbelief just isn't there. It is more of a tragic comedy than anything else. Comical from the perspective of how bad writing can be and that people would be so stupid.<br />Lines like: Go back to the mortuary and take care of the dead corpses.<br />You might need to say it like that to a 12 year old and that seems to be about the age group that is targeted in this series.
1,Great tv show
0,"Good grief, just awful in the same in-bred way that many TV shows are going -- a cheaper and more awful rip-off of already cheap, awful crap that's come out in the recent few years. Is there anyone outside of the same tiny group of dillweeds left in the production industry that can step up?"
1,"My 2.5 year-old son loves this show.  I've tuned in a few times and have been impressed by the high quality of the voice and animation as well as the clarity of explanations of different interesting concepts (e.g. shadows, camoflage).  Here's hoping for more seasons!"
1,We are in love with the &#34;Falaffel Waffle&#34; song!
1,"Better than the average zombie movie. Brad Pitt is an okay actor. At least the zombies move fast enough to make the destruction more believable.  The action is really good too. This is definitely a movie known for a its special effects and not so much its storyline or character development. Some scenes were very well shot, the running through the city getting to the helicopter sequence, jumps to mind. I recommend watching this for some good zombie fun."
1,A fantastic series
1,awesome
1,Had heard of this series and it was very good.
1,Great show! I am very much looking forward to watching more of it!
1,"Tremendous!!!  The only thing that made this movie watchable (and, dare I say, re-watchable) was the gang at Rifftrax working their magic. Keep up the great work!!!"
1,"Good movie, subtitles make action flicks hard to follow."
1,This is a very good show
1,Best show ever!!
1,Funny. Good chemistry. They act like regular people.
1,Big Orson Welles fan; this documentary did not disappoint!
1,Great music and personel people.  Great show thru and thru
1,Great show
1,This was a very surprising movie.  Hard to imagine a love story with a Sci-Fi under plot but that is exactly what happens.  It had many interesting hidden stories that were only tried together and revealed at the very end.  I found this movie very satisfying as both a romance and as a science fiction.
1,My son watched it at school and made us get the movie (9 years old). It's clean and family oriented. So nice for a change!
1,love housewives
1,I favorite show one of them wish I can get it for free
1,LOVE this show
0,"If I ever have to watch this again, it will be way too soon. This is HULK bad, Leperchaun bad, NOAH, bad."
1,"This movie was funny although it seemed like some funny parts seemed forced.  It is a story line that we have seem before, but I thought it was a good movie. Since Madea has been around for a while, it was expected for her character to do certain things."
1,"It was a decent movie. I enjoyed it, but it didn't knock my socks off."
1,This was one the whole family enjoyed. It sneaks up on you a little bit and you really enjoy epic journey of someone who tries to get out of his life rut with the help of helium and surplus balloons.

1,So good!
0,1 Star
1,Amazon is getting a little annoying with these rating request. I'm only half way through season one on Prime. I gave it five stars because it's a show that I look forward to seeing every week when it is airing. I bought some razors (12) that are supposed to last a year. I got an email asking to review them after one shave.
1,Great show
1,Very good films
1,Great writing and acting didn't want it to end!
1,"I wish there was more of these, my son loves it.  There is only one episode so far."
1,Not as good as the BBC version that came out a few years before
1,My son loves it...
1,Great show. Really good season so far.

1,My little ones love this show.
0,The worst movie i ever see
1,Love this show!
1,"Thoroughly enjoyed the series.  I am 71 years old and played baseball and softball until age 49.  The series gave me both a broader sensitivity to the history of baseball and even greater compassion for many players, managers and owners.  I am a devoted fan of Hank Aaron over the many years.  Thank you, Ken Burns and others, for this extraordinary series!"
1,It was just okay.
1,"Nicely done! Well written, well acted, and not too much gratuitous sex and violence."
1,The perfect amount of Fairy Tale and Detective work! I love this show!
1,Very good!
1,One of the best shows out! Great!
0,"slow moving, anti climatic. some nice music."
1,It's a bit like a Disney movie. Young teens will probably like it. I found it too far-fetched.
1,Really great!
1,My child loves this show! It's so creative.
1,"I love Jamie Dornan, he's a Great actor in any thing he stars in."
1,Very well done and too cute!
1,Interesting!
1,Great Kids Movie with energy!
1,Better than expected actually...
1,"Although produced by the same team that gave us Transformers Prime, this series lacks in animation quality (they opted for a cell shaded 3D look with a high speed herky-jerky motion) and character development.  From the first moments of episode one in Prime, you develop an affinity for the characters, both autobot and decepticon.  In Robots in Disguise, the characters may be 3D rendered, but they lack any depth.  If you are a Transformers fan, give this a try simply because it's a continuation of the &#34;Prime/Beast Hunters/Predacons Rising&#34; storyline.  Otherwise, I'd say give this a pass."
1,"Although I did not watch this on Amazon Prime, I have enjoyed the series!"
1,"Entertaining, action-packed movie with some clever story elements.  I enjoyed it."
1,"There isn't anything I've seen where Timothy Olyphant hasn't done a great job, this was a totally different character for him and it was great!"
1,The whole family loves this movie!
1,"It will tide me over until WD starts up again.  I like the story, interesting set up.  I will totally watch it."
1,An interesting twist to the whole Zombie theme
1,Interesting concept and a unique personality.
1,Keeps your attention
1,Was everything I hoped it would be! Actors are amazing!
1,I give the show 5 stars. I give amazon 1 star for the constant emails asking me to rate the show. Although it worked so now I am torn about the stars I gave amazon. This is why I don't rate things. Now I won't be able to sleep. Makes me want to still give amazon the 1 star but its so effective.....
1,Excellent!!!
0,BOOOOORRRRIIIINNNG. It was a snoozer from the start.

1,Classic pre political correctness cartoon from my childhood. Love that it is on Amazon prime
1,Very good!
1,Love it!
1,Great show.  LD gets himself into these situations but it's not always his fault.
1,"I had watched a few years ago, but decided to watch it again and I enjoyed it.  It engages you from the very beginning, and had enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. The only thing I would have negative to say is they dropped the F bomb several times, and I feel it would have been just as good & interesting without the filthy language!!"
1,I had goosebumps watching this and I cried.  Great movie!!! AMEN GOD IS GOOD!
1,"Casanova is an unexpected and surprising take on a well known take.  Instead of focusing on the traditional parts of Casanovas life, the story begins after his infamy and subsequent imprisonment.  I was particularly impressed by the caliber of the secondary characters acting, and the set's attention to detail.  She's design is beautiful and historically accurate. The acting of the lead character was a little rough in the beginning, but as the show moved on, both the actor and the show hit its stride.  If particular note are the historical details of the time.  I enjoyed the scene where an older, widowed woman sinks her time and fortune into the peudosciend and search for meaning in life and the hereafter.  Overall, it was a promising and engaging beginning to what looks like an entertaining show.  I hope the series is given the green light by Amazon.  I, for one, will be watching the rest."
0,Awful
1,"Fun series and eye opening on just how much can go wrong when renovating an older home. However, I'm waiting for just one homeowner to be less than thrilled with the renovation and tell us what they would have done differently. The video (SD) quality was excellent."
1,BETTER THEN THE TV SHOW '24'
1,Love this movie!
1,Good
1,We love this series. We started with season 1 on Netflicks

1,Good stories and snappy characters make for a fun hour.
1,Well dramatized. Awesome.
1,Cute story.
1,Gut-wrenching drama of the reality of what the Marines endured in fighting for our nation and the free world.
1,so boring I had to think back what it was about.
1,I love this show. I have watched it from the beginning.
1,Love this show! Real adults relatiing in a real adult manner (although funnier than most of us)!
1,Love this movie and the ending tribute.
0,Each season has gotten progressively worse with the profanity.
1,Dispels any fascination with youth.
1,Great story lines and a mix of humor along with drama. You really got into the lives of the family members of a family who ran a funeral business. Great acting by all members of the cast.
1,Arnold at his best. Great family movie.
1,Some gore with humorous little twists
1,Love the clay-mation
1,I liked this movie. Found it a little chaotic but it had a lot of heart.

1,Fair
1,Classic that never fails to make every member of the family smile
1,kinda different but very good!- see it if you like grownup science fiction.
1,I have never seen the Scent of a Woman and was delighted to finally do so.  Pacino was masterful and a pleasure to watch.  Worth the entire movie to see the dancing.

1,"A little off-beat, but fun and entertaining.  Can't wait for the second season!"

1,Good flick

1,An perfect look into a spell bounding classic tale of a wonderful culture!

1,"This movie had a good story line, but it could have been developed a little better."
1,"Fixer-upper is fun & fabulous, but execution time of renovations is pure fiction!"
1,The while family love it. It's a good family entertainment. I rarely watch TV but this one has me hooked. Hilarious !!!
1,Quite clearly one of the best period series ever!
1,"We come to watch this show with the previous knowledge we have from watching the Walking Dead and reading the comics. So by know every hard core fan feels they can survive in a zombie apocalypse.  I think the show plays well with that knowledge to add suspense. The slow discovery, the slow realization, time ticking by so fast. I think it was a great idea to  go back to the beginning. The characters look like they have what they need to survive. They are lucky only because they found out sooner. Still, they are like babies learning to walk. Up till now, well done."
1,Excellent cast and story lines
1,"very good storyline, great acting. Worth the watch."
1,"My 3 year old is obsessed, he loves this show!  We had no idea it was also a book series, we are slowly collecting all those now too. ðŸ˜Š"

1,good movie!
1,Highly recommend this video to anyone interested in bicycle touring or nature in general. Beautiful scenery from the tip of Texas to the Arctic Circle. Also narrator provides interesting tidbits regarding wild America and tips on what to pack for a bicycle tour. Never a dull moment.
1,Enjoyed
1,Great job on a modest budget. Enjoyed the film. Was curious to see what got Edwards the Godzilla movie. Good director. Should have been able to do more with Godzilla on a 160M budget.
1,"We thought it was hilarious, adult humor."
1,Great!
1,"Smart, fast dialogue, we binge watched it. :)"
0,"Take the tinfoil hat off and hear me out.<br />1. One undeniable truth about humans is that we cannot keep secrets when more than one of us is sharing it.<br />One person can keep a secret.  Two people ? Probably not. Three people?  Unlikely. Hundreds of people?  You've got to be kidding me.<br />2.  Wake up - conspiracy theories make money!  Conspiracy theories are a cottage industry, worth millions of dollars each year.<br />3.  Kookery set aside, it is a well made movie."
1,It was good
1,Different than exspected. a Good movie with an unexspected twist and a tale.
1,Querky and funny.
1,We are just catching up on the season.
1,Ok
1,Great show! Starts a little slow but picks up by episode 3.
1,Excellent can't wait for the whole season!
1,Thought it was fantastic.
1,Another vampire movie with a twist. Some parts had me losing interest  but my daughter and her husband enjoyed the episodes.
1,Hilarious!
0,"Stacy Keach's worst movie, and that is really saying something. Not worth the price of free."
1,"Fun to watch, if you like this sort of thing."
1,I was hooked on this series from the pilot.  I think it is well written and entertaining.  Tho cast works very well together but my favs are Harvey & Mike.  I can't wait for season 6.
0,Stupid and vapid.  Dispenses left-wing propaganda and talking points unchallenged.  Jeff Daniels not believable as a news reader.  Characters air out their personal lives in front of everyone in the newsroom.  Does not attempt to present a realistic portrait of a news operation.
1,Awesome
1,One of the best written and acted dramas ever produced.
1,Gripping
1,Funny
1,Great insight into this character.
1,Outstanding writing and coverage of a very difficult and complex and stigmatized topic.  Thank you and bravo to actors and all involved with production!
1,This Show is so funny!
1,"I found this mini series because I had watched &#34;Turn-Washington Spies&#34; and this is much better, of course with a star studded cast.  They did David McCullough's book John Adams justice."
1,"Startling yet poignant.  What an amazing story and how sad, too."
1,Very interesting story.
1,Lots of Action!
0,Terrible movie
1,Classic. Always love this movie
1,Great! My new favorite.
1,Watch this series over and over
0,"Plotless. Annoying camera shaking and jumping and stupid flickering lights to ineffectively compensate for lack of budget, lack of plot, and lack of substance."
1,Very good clean movie.
1,Seasons get better and better. Favorite show.
1,Great series!!
1,"I read every one of the Mars books by Edgar Rice Burroughs as a child. Several times. [[ASIN:B000AQ26WO Edgar Rice Burroughs]] He's also the author of the better known Tarzan books. This movie brought the books to life and I'd like to see more of them in this format. The lead character who played John Carter was very good and I really enjoyed the movie, as did my children."
1,"I saw this movie long ago when it was first released, but the message it delivers is even more timely now. Those who haven't seen it lately should probably take a second look. Very pertinent to what is happening now!"
1,"My wife is Chinese, so we always watch shows with English subtitles. It's easier to keep up with what's being spoken with subtitles. Somehow I missed that in the description, or mistakenly assumed it had them. Disappointed only with that. Otherwise we watch it more on Amazon Prime for now since it has subtitles. We wish more movies, although American-made, spoken  in the English language, also had some forms of English subtitles or captions."
1,Loved it
0,Started pretty well but could have been called two days because that would have been as long as it should  have been.
1,Interesting pacing and plot.  I don't normally like Westerns but I found this movie and its plot to be original and interesting.
1,OMG!!!! Giovanni never fails to deliver and now I am dying to see more. This is so horrible the anticipation.. This better be picked up and continue at least as long as breaking bad because a nice Cranston fix would be lovely. The whole storyline is so epic and perfect for Ribisi. He is so under rated. CONfidence man I love it!!
1,Awesome show !!!
1,A fun movie to watch.
1,"From watching the preview, I thought it would be a good thriller, but as I watched it, I was very disappointed. I gave it 3 stars any who."
1,My kids loved it.
1,This is an amazing documentary.  I love his attitude toward the horses and appreciate people who respect animals.
1,"Although I could see the metaphoric tying of all the loose knots of the series, I wasn't so distracted by the process that I couldn't enjoy the excellent acting, dialogue, scenery and music."
1,"Great show, strong story and well produced with believable acting...."
1,Great show very funny!
1,According to my memory there were two movies titled I spit on your grave with basically the same plot. The inferior version had the worst rapist as the sheriff or deputy and the removal of the rapists was much more violent than in the better version that declined to silly ness in how she dispatched the rapists.
1,Good old series put more series on.
1,Great show... Great mustache... And always Forthwith!!!??
1,"Bad ass- and funny, too"
1,Oldie but a goodie
1,Looking forward to season 7
1,"It is just a great show.  While beong entertained, I also learn something of history."
1,Love it
1,Freaking awesome.... Nail biting.....All of the cast fit there rolls perfectly...... Sad that it has less episodes than the first 2 seasons... Fans were Rob of 9 episodes stay with original episodes count stop cutting the episodes...24 or 22....
1,Love this show! Yet again another great season that keeps you guessing!
1,Best ever. So funny and I miss it so much
1,It would have been better if the translations could have stayed on-screen longer. As it stands you need to speed read and miss the visual.
1,One of Pacino's best roles
1,"Ty Burrell and Luke Wilson are a little mis cast. Could move a little quicker. OK script, questionable direction, actors doing the best with what they've got. Highlight is Wiig and Hader at the dentist office. I suspect that the strong promise of playing brother and sister was too much for them to pass up despite some flaws in the script."
0,"Fluff piece.  Primary protagonists are likable, but after 3 episodes I'd like to see something of substance developing.  Two people, plus friends, who don't know themselves or each other and respond to every situation with sex and coarse language. Do they have an OFF switch?"
1,It was very good until the finale. Just ruined it all.
1,Excellent
0,A bit slow and confusing to follow
0,It was pretty boring
1,Very good
1,Thought it was funny. I will definitely watch again.
1,Great piece of history!
1,Started out a little slow. But picked up after learning the characters. All in all a good one to watch.
1,Best series ever made. Period.
1,Great stuff. Finally got to see the surprising manner in which it closed.
1,Very entertaining.  Love Jeff Daniels.
1,Victor Hugo really captures the idea of redemption in his novel les miserable. The music adds another dimension and the 2012 cast members really bring the essence of Hugo's classic to life. Could've done without the violence heaped on Fantinebut overall I really Love this movie.
1,It was ok nothing special
1,The movie was great with great acting.
1,Fast paced and extremely entertaining.  I want more!!!!
1,Have enjoyed watching this new show. Funny as well as thoughtful adult humor.
1,Still as good
1,The addition of Rob Lowe and Adam Scott really put this over the top.  So good.
1,Can never get enough of Lucy and the gang!!!
1,It was  ok.
1,Action packed thrill ride!!! Heck of a film!!!!
1,Only half way through season 1 but good so far
1,A good is somewhat biased look at what Patton was like.  George C. Scott makes the perfect Patton except for the voice.
1,That was a great movie
1,excellent movie
1,A video that will enlighten you about Mongolia.
1,Superb.
1,"Loved it, great show I would have loved a season 2."
1,This is a wonderful program for kids and adults.  I found it educational for my grandchildren and informative for me as an adult.  It was so nice to view something that had no violence and yet so entertaining for my grandchildren who are 3 and 6.  Please make available for viewing more often.<br />I give you a thumbs up for bringing this type of programming to those of us who live with our Kindle products everyday.
1,Great Movie!!!
1,Realistically written. The characters make sense given they were randomly picked in the plot. A nice mix.
1,"Enjoyed series, can't wait for the next one.  Great drama and lots of action, it also has laugh out loud situations."
0,It's really like every other treasure hunting show. Some clues here and there... but really?? Some serious stretching going on here.
1,"This series snuck up on me..the more I watched, the better it got. There are also some very notiable character actors in this series.<br />I must admit, I kept waiting for Mr. Nightly to show me his evil vampire side..."
1,Great show !  Captivating!
1,"Please invest in this product!! Compelling characters and great plots, give us more!"
1,Very informative &#34;modern&#34; documentary which discusses several advanced jet propelled fighters that thankfully never made it into full-scale Nazi production before the War ended.  Use of modern 3D computer reproductions of these aircraft was extremely effective.
1,"Great show everybody! Yes, I did."
1,"A wonderful and creative show, keep it coming!"
1,"Excellent show! Great story and very talented actors.  Love the main character, Cullen, he is a &#34;man's man&#34; with no drama, tough, cool, and honorable. I wish there were more shows like that in television."
1,"A favorite of mine in my younger days, and now my son gets a kick out of it. It's silly enough for the kiddos, yet tongue-in-cheek enough for adults to enjoy. As an avid They Might Be Giants fan, I love the incorporation of their songs in a couple episodes! Definitely worth the trip down memory lane."
1,Perfect
1,fun
1,"Super weird movie, def makes your mind spin and think of all kinds of different things. Worth watching for sure!"
1,"We really enjoyed watching all of the episodes and are sorry that there are no more to watch.  The episodes were riveting, frequently involving moral dilemmas that provoked a great deal of thought."
1,a real family movie
1,Worth your time .
1,LOVE The fact that this movie is a true story! Enjoyed actors too.
1,Great movie! Loved it!!
1,"A story which stretches the imagination (read, no way this could happen), but is an interesting thought experiment.  What would happen if you could experience another's life as they do?  How could you not fall in love with that person who shares everything you experience, not just intimately, but totally.  Disclaimer: I'm a fan of Zoe Kazan, and haven't seen a movie of hers yet that I didn't like, so that might influence my judgement here somewhat."
1,"&#34;Mozart in the Jungle&#34; is essentially a workplace sitcom, but the workplace, a major symphony orchestra, makes all the difference. If you're a musician, you know most of these people. I'm really enjoying working my way through the episodes."
1,Not enough facts.
1,Glad I came back to watch this epic movie. This came out when I was 14 during the internet boom. Solid cinematography and story line.
1,"Awesome!!! From the beginning until the end. :). I love all the Transformers movies!! Very entertaining...very thrilling and made me laugh  in between.. Woo-hoo!! Great job, you guys!!"
1,This is wa great video with balanced presentation of opinions about the theses. If only 50% of what Kurzweil predicts is achieved it will be a turning point in human history.
1,The drama that keeps you addicted as the Grantham ladies become more independent!
0,Slow moving
1,It's good but the ending and action are not all that. It definitely had potential though.
1,Very interesting especially because a particle collider is being used in Cern Switzerland.  The pilot left off with a cliffhanger which was very intriguing but since the show was never picked up we'll never know what happened.
1,"The movie was excellent.  I watched it twice.  However the dialog sound was poor.  This was especially bad with Mr. Crowe.  The battle sounds, war sounds, singing and etc was very loud but appropriate to the story.  I thought that there was something wrong with my tv.  I amplifyied the sound and watched it again.  I heard Mr. Crowe better but it was still somewhat soft."
1,Funny guy
1,Best show I have watched in a long time
0,too violent
1,"A good start, but a pat ending. Fun, though."
1,Couldn't stop watching it.  Anxiously awaiting season 6 - unfortunately the last.
1,Real mirror of the political culture in DC.
1,This is one of those movies I come back to again and again.  It's a sweet movie with Peter  O'Toole at his best.
1,Awesome and super funny!!! Great chemistry and humor!
1,One of my all time favorite!
1,What an exciting season!  All of the family members love it.  Best season ever!!
1,This was a great movie! Very touching...
1,I really enjoyed the TV show &#34;NYPD Blue&#34;. It was the closest to reality Police program I've ever enjoyed.
1,Very heartwarming. I love Chloe Grace. I think she is an awesome actress.
1,I hope this series continues.
1,Starts off stronger than season 1 finished. Excellent series. Very thought provoking.
1,I love this family!
1,Only in America! What a great success story! What a humble and gentle man!
1,"Excellent movie, right in line with the Lassie tradition. The lad who plays Lassie's owner is the perfect pawn - he's downtrodden and pathetic, but Lassie is unwaveringly devoted to him. Peter O'Toole swings between bad guy and good guy, ending up on the side of good."
1,Great show
1,My kids love it
1,Love this series. Cant wait for this season to start.
1,Graet Movie
1,great movie..deft. a eye opener

1,Kid liked it.
1,It was entertaining.
1,This show is awesome.  I discovered it on Amazon Prime and am so bummed that I've finished it already.
0,Slow moving .. Didn't want to finish the show .
1,"It was a beautiful movie with mystery, comedy, and love!"
1,Excellent!!
1,Plot fizzles at the end
1,"This really isn't a &#34;movie&#34;, so-to-speak, just my opinion, anyway. It's good, to be clear, but it's more like, listening to an author, tell of his experience while in a coma, or the writings in his book, per-say. It is quite compelling! I just expected, I guess, for it to have been illustrated into a movie. Had I known that, before purchasing it, I would have known what to expect? Then, I probably would have rated this with 5 stars."
1,Mine favorite stargate series
1,It Was Alright But Nothing To Write About
0,this movie was horrible
1,was good - recommend
0,bad
0,blah. No sizzle.
1,Not very good
1,"If it weren't for the sex scenes that I have to fast forward through, I'd give it five stars."
0,It continues to get less and less plausible.
1,No doubt the best informed and nuanced &#34;crime show&#34; to date.
1,Great
1,"Great 1st season, I had to watch all episodes at once!"
0,"Let bad, even for Wil."
0,The worst of all the transformer movies!
1,"As a hiker that might someday do the PCT, I was interested in that part of it, and thought this was a movie about that.<br /><br />In reality it was more about her personal relationship struggles (mostly with her mother).<br /><br />A major criticism my PCT-experienced friends have is that they failed to capitalize on some of the more beautiful parts of the PCT. Mostly they chose boring, less scenic locations than they could have. If she hiked all the way from Mexico to the Bridge of the Gods (Washington / Oregon border), why not choose some of the best parts to film at? (Crew didn't want to hike in to these more remote places? Had to stick close to roads?)"
1,good moive
1,Sad but truthfully told.
1,Love the show
1,So sad this ended.
1,Fun show!
1,This is one of my favorite animated shows of all time.
1,My daughter loves Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood!
1,Always a great drama
1,Season 4 was very good and I will have to let my daughter watch it as she is a huge fan of Frozen and the story line developed well and it will be interesting to see what happens in season 5
1,Great series.
1,My girls absolutely LOVE this show!! And I like it a little myself :)
1,c
1,"Very engaging, Any more Seasons?"
1,So profound! I will probably have to watch this again someday! I never say that!
1,great!
1,"Great story lines, always flows well and appears there may be some adlib included which just makes it more enjoyable. The characters play off of each other so well, it is just fun to watch. The underlying quality of the characters, how they relate to each other and even though they sometimes dislike each other or disagree, there is always a tone of respect and friendship. Great, great show. Love the characters, love the actors."
1,Great
1,Excellent show.  I loved all the characters and the story line.
1,Awesome movie.  Loved it!
1,Fast moving believable action!
1,Slow to start but great movie
1,Great show to watch without commercials!
1,My children love Shaun the Sheep. I must admit I like it too.
1,"Enjoyed what I've seen of this series, so far.  Will continue to watch the rest of the episodes when time permits."
0,Unable to view video due to it would not download we tried 4 times
1,"Dysfunctional family at it's best, but I really enjoyed how each person was dealing with the issues at hand, good popcorn movie."
1,Interesting enough movie for a chick flick.
1,Good movie
1,"I really like the authenticity of the hacker reality. I think the title of Mr. Robot is misleading though. That's actual code on the laptop screens, which is great, but the show may not appeal to non-techies. I hope there are more seasons!"
0,Can't follow the Brit dialogue
1,"I had heard through friends that this show was great but never really gave it much thought. While browsing the local video store I noticed you could rent all 7 seasons and it was then that I decided I wanted to give the show a try. Was beyond excited when I realized that I will be able to watch all 7 seasons on Amazon. Just finished the first season last night and can't wait to jump right into the next one. I have never been one to really watch or get too involved with any television shows, but, this show has definitely peaked my interest and keeps me wanting to watch more and more. Since I have started watching SOA there have been MANY late nights of watching!!!!"
1,Riveting!
1,"Love it, great for kids!"
1,"Fantastic,funny"
1,Great horror movie. .enjoyedâ˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†
1,"It was one of those nights i could not sleep, it was a great movie, i stayed away the whole time, so it had to be go good, some times i watch tv just to relax and see if i can fall asleep. this movie keep me wide away, would love to watch it again with my husband."
1,Loved the suspense!  I didn't see it coming and that is my favorite kind of mystery.
1,Great insider prospective.
1,Was great a must see
1,Great show
1,...Cait is a hit.
0,Disappointing
1,Awesome
1,suspenseful and action packed.
1,Really enjoyed it.
1,Excellent picture quality.
1,Excellent series
1,Good stuff.  Funny.
1,Very well done
1,My 8 year old and I loved it!
1,This move is okay.  Its a little slow and I didn't appreciate the language in places.  Very predictable ending.
1,"This is one of the very best series around: the characters are well drawn and interesting, the story-line is appealing, the setting is realistic, the music (and intro) are catchy -- hopefully there will be a Season 3!"
0,Just depressing. Kept waiting for a redemptive or happy ending but you don't really get one. Best you can say is at least your family will not likely be this messed up.
1,Big fan of Julia louis-Dreyfus from Seinfeld days. She just has a great way of conveying aggression frustration and pain in every line to express the incompetency around her. Tony Hale is just redilculous I love that guy. Great show and you seebone episode you're hooked.
1,Good story.  Decent action.
1,Entertaining
0,"Some good banter. Majority was a lot of nothing that led no where and then confused. Are maniacs this boring?  Was hoping it was a re-imagining of a book I recently read about 3 &#34;friends&#34; who get lost in the woods and are the victims of a very weird cult. But, no. And these kids couldn't even get lost properly.  Boring.  Confusing. Stifled.<br /><br />The name of the book is The Ritual.  And it was 4 friends, not 3. If they made that book into a movie, and did it well, it would be the scariest movie ever made. Or in the top ten."
1,"If you love Quentin Tarantino type genre, give this a view.  Really good graphics along with wry humor."
1,It was good
1,Awesome! As I remember it from my childhood days! My son isn't as thrilled though.
1,Good movie and great to hear from all people that worked with him over the years!<br />Such a horrible loss of a hysterical man.
0,"Great characters and outstanding plotting with fantastic period sets is very marred by the incessant use of profanity. I do not understand why HBO equates literary quality with soft core porn. Now Netflix and Amazon made movies are following suit. Speaking of suit, 'Suits' is an exceptional dramedy which has a modicum pf light profanity used to enhance the plot line. HBO, Netflix, and Amazon should take a look at this type of quality, adult based fare."
1,Love this show.  I wish they would bring it back!!!
1,I am a fan of old sci-fi movies and I think that this one holds up well.  The 2008 remake does not compare.  I was surprised how good the movie was.  I recommend.
1,Our 4 year old loves Transformers ROD!
1,I like the movie very much but it was more of a love story it surprised me . Richard Gere was wonderful as always. But the fact mental illness was not what I expected it to believe I guess that's why I was wondering about the ones that were it surprised me not Ä·nowing what to expect. The movie was amazing greater when I understood it. Thank you.
1,Very interesting British period
0,Kinda boring. The kids were not that interested either.
1,the best show ever
1,THis is my favorite show!
1,I loved all the action and the plot! Hope their's a second!
1,My girls are 2 & 3 and love Bubble Guppies
1,I find her a very entertaining comic.  Like most good comics she weaves in personal stories and some social commentary.  I will leave it to others to pick apart the actual performance but she makes me laugh.
1,"I love this show. I watched it with my eldest son and daughter when it first came out, and now I get to watch it with my youngest son all over again. We both look forward to sitting down and watching it together.<br /><br />It's such an epic show. Everyone should give it a chance."
1,Good
1,Great
1,Suspenseful!  Great foreign film. Better than American remake.
1,Fun show.  Well acted and written.  Kirsten Bell is cute and very changeable in appearance and expression - she makes the show fun.  The Logan character is the most interesting.  The actor playing Keith Mars is excellent.
0,eh
0,The language is terrible
1,Excellent...for the theatre afficionados: Well acted...well written...fun characterizations...and touching.
1,"As I did not watch this on Amazon Prime, I have enjoyed this series."
1,My sons love this show.  They end up singing the songs and sharing what they learn with daddy.
1,Great great show!!
1,Great movie not like book
1,One of the funniest movies ever made.
1,Awesome show!
1,This is one of my son's favorite movies.
1,Interesting views around determined aging woman.
0,Kinda cheesy
1,Real simple but got the facts
1,Movie was good not great
1,I though it was good enough for my horror collection myself<br />I look for women aspects of the movie
1,Started with season 1 and I can't stop watching it!
1,Liked it all.
1,"Enjoyed it, looking forward to more episodes."
0,"terrible movie, don't waste your time."
1,I'm in love
1,"It was fun but it needed more plot, character development, etc. Great premise that wasn't developed to its full potential."
0,Nothing new here. Same ol' formula and not funny anymore. Watched about 20 minutes and gave up.
1,I loved the movie. Very real moments captured on screen. It kept both of our interest through to the end. I have thought back on certain scenes since watching and a lot of moments were eye opening. Two scenes were favs. The one the child she meets sings and the one her mother is reflecting on never getting to be her ... Always living her life as a mother or wife and just finally getting to a place of her own and the tragedy of that thought with all that was taking place.
1,"Great show.  Not the best ever, but something to do on a Summer's evening. Entertaining."
1,"Characters to love and characters to hate in some tense situations. Sometimes the writing is illogical, but overall the show is entertaining."
1,"wonderful, however small differences from book to movie aggravate me. Such as why Gale is put on the whipping post"
1,Great Humor! ROFL. The Best 99 cent rental that I have ever made :-)<br />It reminded me of the same type of humor used in movies like &#34; THIS IS SPINAL TAP&#34;.<br />Very interesting characters. I LOVE IT!
1,Very good fast moving show!
0,"What a waste of time. Idiotic plot. Awkward acting. If it weren't for Idris Elba, I would never have purchased this."
1,Can't wait to see the next show
1,"What a great family movie!  Sure it was sad at times but it really pulls you in and makes you identify with the characters, especially &#34;Little Boy&#34;.  Clever use of historical facts and events of that era in the fictional story.  My boys (15 and 10) were glad they watched it."
1,Excellent
1,Really like this.  I had not seen this and am glad that I watched it.
1,Great movie with sweet message.  Age 10 is about the right age.
1,"Love learning new things!  Very interesting series. (Background music was too loud at times and repetitive, but okay)"
1,OK
1,Honest. Funny. Verry real.
1,I am a Keanu fan.
1,Superb acting by all.  Great insight to the transgender and cross-dressing communities.  We binge watched over two night and loved it.  Looking forward to season two.
0,Lower the grade B.  Worst special-effects I've ever seen
1,Good
1,Great show!!! Looking forward to more episodes &#60;fingers crossed&#62;
1,Enjoying this
1,"LOVE the show. The streaming of this series has been almost perfect. (I stupidly upgraded to Windows10, and there were issues with the Silverlight software.)"
1,"This was a different side to BC, thoughtful, pained and multidimensional. And the plot was like seeing Downton Abbey and a more conniving Lady Mary-I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
1,"I really love this film. Not only the part how this movie describes human condition but also the historical part of the movie. I highly recommend this stylistically well made movie because it is just so amazing when I see the horse jumping around the field and bring hopes to the people in the Great War.<br />The background of the movie happened during the World War I. The horse, named Joey, did not give up on his life during the Great War. Joey brought hopes to the devastated soldiers on both Allies and Germans. During World War I, millions of people died because the war was fought in a different way, as known as trench war. Generals make soldiers dig trenches to make defiance and it makes the offence become very hard, and even more, the troops are already using machine guns from the beginning of the war and millions of people will die under the machine guns. When Joey ran in to the field, there are wires and bodies everywhere. Suddenly, Joey was trapped in the wires and both Germans and British soldiers canâ€™t believe what they are seeing â€“ a living animal at the middle of the war zone. The appeared of Joey makes both German and British send a soldiers to help rescue him and that makes troops on both sides disengage for a while. After Joey was rescued, he was send back to the doctor for surgery and at the same place is where he met his original owner, Albert. After the war, Joey and Albert went back to home together and the movie end with a happy ending.<br />After watching the whole movie, I can feel the powerful vitality spreading from Joey, miracles happened on this creature. He makes me believe that I shouldnâ€™t give up on anything. Really, everyone should go watch this movie. It definitely worth it."
1,Very interesting and fact based.
1,Very good movie
1,"The movie is a good comedy,  about a guy who wants to get laid with a sensual neighbor, and the situations that arise due to that. The end is unexpected."
1,"Kids like this one, I would be fine never watching it again"
1,Great
1,loved the show
1,"I absolutely adore Brando, and paired with Leigh's fabulous performance was Ike watching magic! It's funny how this film is decades old, yet still posesses a timeless brilliance that shined even when it was first released ."
1,"Well acted, very interesting stories and accepting for Cambridge, gorgeous scenery!!"
0,Was not able to access this program from Amazon Prime and will be seeking a refund.
1,Great show.  I love Larry David's sense of humor.

1,The show was very good. I would watch a second season.
1,reminds me of the Beatles
0,"I love this flick!  I was very happy to find a dvd copy under $50, and i was very happy with the prompt delivery.  However, I was disappointed to see that it's an obvious bootleg, but I just thought,&#34;Oh well.. At least I have a copy.&#34;  As I watched the dvd, I was further disappointed to find out it is edited for language... Lame..."
1,Awesome
1,"I thought this movie was very well done.  It had everything, love, sadness, action, compassion and understanding,great acting, good cast...well done Russell Crowe!"
1,Engaging plots. Great casting.
1,Funny teenage movie
0,Not nearly as interesting a season as other seasons have been.  I'm not a big fan of Bayou and Louisiana folklore either.  This season seemed to drag on and on.  I'm ready for the next season though!
1,Great classic.  Paul Newman did a fantastic job.
0,Stupid gratuitous violence...not one lick of substance.
1,amazing
1,Not bad - not great.
1,"The movie doesn't really do the book justice, but it had its own personal charm to it."
0,"Tired, predictable, not a laugh to be had for an entire season. Watch Veep if you want to know how to do political comedy."
1,Amazing movie and a great tribute to paul walker R.I.P.
1,"Watch it for fun. Not for education.<br />I forgot how many familiar faces were in this flick. It was nice to re-watch for that purpose. My main problem was while the theme is mostly anti-war, it consistently glorifies it in a really simplistic and cliche way that makes you feel like a lot of directorial inspiration was spawned from the success of Braveheart. Or from WWII propaganda flicks.<br /><br />The ever-evil Lucious Malfoy killing babies and whatever was 100% evil, though - and none of that sulky &#34;I'm afraid of Voldemort&#34; nonsense. Nice and simplistic counter to Gibson's faux-complicated, overly stereotypical, quiet, reluctant war hero with a haunted past.<br /><br />However, at no point in the actual Revolutionary War is there an evil Lucious Malfoy killing babies, nor did Mel Gibson's character actually exist in real life. Which is fine, I can accept a good historical fiction. However as Spike Lee has said, &#34;It was a complete whitewashing [no pun intended, I'm sure] of history&#34; just like a propaganda flick. And not just in regards to race relations. Impact of regional, economy, villianizing of the British. I'm sure if this was rebooted, everything would be darker and more complicated. Alas, no more Heath Ledger to help make things dark and complicated. Also the failings of the Continental Army and militia is overly simplified to the point where it's just ugly.<br /><br />But that's cool. No harm no foul. Just keep in mind that while set in a semi-historical time period, none of this actually ever happened. And TchÃ©ky Karyo was boss."
0,"Uh.....my god, pretty bad, even if it's on prime. But thank you Amazon for putting this on prime so I didn't have to pay to see how bad it was! My suggestion is if you haven't seen the original or even if you have, I'd watch the first one! So bad, I can't even begin to start with what went wrong here."
1,The series started out good but then dragged the story line out for the rest of the episodes.
1,Love this show. Very well done. I will be getting the books because I am too impatient to wait for the next season to continue the story.
1,Truly funny show.
1,Love this show!  So glad it was picked up again!
1,Somewhat entertaining... Good cast... But anticlimactic.
1,I couldn't get interested in this movie.
0,Long and boring.
1,My kids really loved this at. First but tired of it more quickly than other shows we've purchased
0,Silly movie.  Everyone cheating on everyone.  I expected more.
1,Outstanding introduction to the men and the machines that made  der panzer krieg possible.
0,Poor story and even worse acting.  Reese Witherspoon should give back her Oscar for making this mess.
1,"Boy oh boy did this video bring back memories!!!! These men sang love ballads better at the time than any other male singing group in my opinion. If you weren't in love before hearing one their songs, afterwards you can bet you would be :) I really enjoyed the music and the memories to the maxâ™¡â™¡â™¡"
1,So good
1,Have really enjoyed watching the show and found myself  looking forward to watching the next episode.  Have not checked to see if there is a season 2 yet.  Hoping there is.
1,My 3yr. old loves Curious George and his adventures.
1,Excellent performance of all actors.
1,Watched a couple of episodes and became FAN of this series!
1,Cheesy but brings back good memories or the original show
1,what a depressing movie!
1,This movie gave me so many feels
1,Cute story!
1,Lots of action but little mad max.
1,"Great if you like some diversions into good historical fiction. The effect is true to the essence of Marquis de Sade: his unstoppable compulsion and his affect on the social mores of those around him, in the culture at-large at the time, and to this day in the &#34;conflict&#34; between pure desire and &#34;proper&#34; behavior. The film is not pornographic, or pornographic for its own sake, using just enough to affirm the power of Sade's appeal and compulsion. Everything else aside, the gem of the film is the depiction of Sade's compulsive behavior: relentless, purposeful, never reflective, unstoppable under impossible circumstances. The film takes place in a mental hospital, where Sade has been confined by officialdom in the hope his volatile influence on French culture will be eliminated (and a progressive pastor/superintendent hopes he may be reformed). But he must write and publish his pornography. Sade will find a way despite every possible effort by the officials to remove any ability. Again and again, just when you think he can't possibly find a way, he does, an in ways that richly illustrate Sade's utter, devouring compulsion. The effect is powerful. For me, the lasting impression is the incredible power of the human spirit against all odds, up to and including destruction."
1,"I always liked watching this show when it was on prime time. Season 5 was probably my least favorite of all five seasons,  but it still gets a 2 thumbs way up from me!"
1,"Great show!  Well-written, well acted.  Quality television."
1,My 3 year just loves it. Would like to see more episodes
1,Great movie worth my money
1,Love it!
1,I need more!!
1,3 year old lost interest quick.

1,"The story was very interesting as it depicted a modern romance between members of the  Ascendant Coalition. I like the idea of  showing a romance between  a woman of Indian descent and a black male. Especially, with the black male playing the role of a Republican and the Indian being a democrat supporting future President Barack Obama. Some of the dialog between the mixed members of the Family of the Indian Father  and Black Female Mother were simply hilarious an well done."
1,Love this show enjoyed it so much
1,now waiting for Season 5!
1,My son likes dinosaur shows.
1,Not the best acting for a war movie
1,We really enjoy watching this off bear comedy.
1,Action
1,I wish this was more than two seasons.
1,Another fabulous season from Aaron Sorkin.
1,Love it!
1,"Very creative, a great new twist on a detective investigative series."
1,Complex characters. So much more than all the sex hype.
1,Exciting plot and great acting
1,"I watched the Jobs vs Gates episode and I don't know whether to watch the other ones, because there are some inaccuracy and misconception in the program.  To avoid the &#34;liability&#34;, they put &#34;Dramatizations inspired by History&#34; and &#34;altered for Dramatic Purposes&#34; at the beginning of the program.  Well, how can documentaries be &#34;inspired by History&#34;? It is very irresponsible.  The misconception is that one of the person giving the comment said that mainframe are these super computers operated by computer experts and Bill Gates know how to do it.  Well, actually, when in 1982, an Apple II can be already more complicated than the mainframes.  So knowing how to deal with the mainframe is not something &#34;genius&#34;.  The second inaccuracy is about Microsoft bundling Word and Excel with every copy of Windows.  As far as I know, that was not true.  You buy Windows, and all the time, you also have to buy Word, Excel, or Office separately.  The TV program said there was no choice for people to buy Windows without having Word or Excel -- that Word and Excel were already bundled and people have to get it together with Windows or a new PC."
1,"This is one of the best series we have seen in a along time.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat, but without the violence that usually goes with suspense/thrillers.  Be careful!  It's addictive!"
1,"This is a really good story about male friendship, oh and they are all pigs."
1,"All these years later, still relevant and still hysterically funny!"
1,"I met Michael Connelly at a book signing for Lost Light. I was reading City of Bones at the time and I told him I thought Brasher was too young for Harry. SPOILER ALERT. Connelly said, &#34;Don't worry. It won't last.&#34; I'm a die-hard fan and was wondering for years who could play Bosch. Russell Crowe? Anyway, I was thrilled and also apprehensive to see that Harry made it to the screen AND it was under Connelly auspices. The review part: Welliver seems a little talkative and maybe a little too happy, but if he were as taciturn as Harry, it wouldn't make for very compelling TV. Jerry Edgar seems a little young but I'm glad they made him confident and able to hold his own with Harry. I could go on and on... Suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my first binge session. Knowing the books adds to the pleasure -- you feel a little like you've been through stuff with Harry before. Purely as police procedural and character study, still excellent. The L.A. location photography is beautiful!"
1,Sad to see this show be over....  I love to watch that Amazon Prime has this on Instant Video!
1,Can't get much better than True Blood. Watching night after night until eyes bleed...
1,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ONE.
1,I love Outlander and I can't wait for the next season to come. I have only watched season 1 with 8 episodes. I bought each one for 1.99 lol. I'm laughing cuz I was only going to buy one- to appease my friend because she loves it so much. Boy was I hooked! she has seen all 16 and I wish season 2 was available now on amazon. (Netflix does not have it  streamed).
0,host is not the best unless you like juvenile humor.
1,"Sadly, this movie has not aged well.  It is simply not as funny as I remember it being when I watched it  20+ years ago, and Woody's self loathing and outsized inability to enjoy life is just grating."
1,Really cute & fun movie. Beautiful animation. We will be purchasing this one for sure.
1,"Dated, but still entertaining."
1,I love this show
1,Great movie like watching it with the family.
1,Good entertainer for Kids.
1,"Not one of my favorite Spaghetti westerns.  I am a big fan of Terrence Hill, but this is not some of his best work.  His voice was also dubbed in this movie and that was a problem for me.  The story moved along slowly.  Not enough action.  I can not recommend."
1,My four month old loves this show almost as much as i did when i was a child. I love being able to watch thisshow with him.
1,I love this show
1,Srcastic and funny !
1,This show is fabulous. I am learning so much. I love the culture elements. Love how the elders are brought in for their experience and ideas. Much good luck to Vivian and Ben. Thank you so much for this show which is your life.
1,"I have watched this movie several times and most likely will watch it again.  I is somewhat of a &#34;sleeper&#34; movie that did not get much press at the time of its release;  I saw it in the theater at the time and did not think that much about it, but sometimes that happens when the brain get totally immersed in a plot that it kind of checks out......to be revisited by the subconscious later......or, something like that :-).<br />  Has a great cast and an unusual storyline."
1,This was purchased as a gift and the person who received it loves it.
1,Very exciting and thrilling keeps your attention! FREE ON PRIME!
1,Entertaining!
1,"Fantastic plot towards the North Korea.....Amazing to see how they behaves and try damage control without effect.<br />Highlight is when they bring a equipment to the dear Leader, to perform the Art of making Pizza......"
1,simple story need to read movie probably could have told more of his story
1,it's way funny can't wait to see more!!!
1,"Charlotte was sexy as hell, as usual, but I didn't like how it ended."
1,"A good rendition of a short lived actor who touched so many in the time he had.. Reviews the movies he starred in and the way he crafted his charactors, putting so much of himself in them.A good watch for Heath Ledger fans. Well worth the time."
0,Wish I had read the reviews first.
1,Cute
1,Love this show.  It is awesome.
1,The more times you watch this the better it gets. It's not just for kids.
1,I will always love Lucy shows
1,"Well written and acted, but stretched out with various tangential subplots from what should have been three episodes at most. And although I figured out who the culprit was about half way in, the actual presentation of the &#34;climax&#34; was less than satisfying.  Better than most TV, but nothing really noteworthy."
1,Suits is an amazing show.  You will love it!  Be prepared to get hooked!
1,"lors of action, great cars, and AARON ECKHART!!"
1,"Like &#34;The Honorable School Boy&#34; before it the meticulous analyst reels in the evil doers except this time they are politicians and venture capitalists not communists. Worricker is like Smiley, relentless and crafty."
1,The best series of the season.  We loved it.  Looking forward to the next season!
1,Good season!
1,"I don't do these reviews...at all.<br />After watching the 1st episode of this particular series I felt that I would chime in.<br />Amazon has a real winner here; great production, cinematography and a real solid plot based on an outstanding book.<br />My vote, full speed ahead with this one Amazon!<br />Keep up the great work."
1,It's a fun ride.
1,"Impressively subtle. Deviously underwhelming. You sit back to savor the content and the your realize your sucked into the story. I felt like a junky, I had to se the next one."
1,It's really really good!
1,Great show
1,I was entertained and was starting to believe some of the facts they were explaining until I googled it and realized it was a &#34;mockumentary&#34; not a documentary. Guess the jokes on me!
0,"It was okay. I liked Emma better than Bella. There were too many supporting characters that I did not like, and some episodes were poorly written because the situations did not make sense. For example, in one episode Cleo's father says good-bye to Cleo because Cleo is going to a party with her friends. It was obvious that he approved of the party Cleo was going to. Cleo's sister claims to be sick, but then sneaks out of the house. Cleo's father just sits on the couch talking with his new wife, and doesn't check to see if his daughter is feeling okay. What kind of father just sits on a couch and doesn't make sure his daughter is feeling okay? He also knows that his youngest daughter tends to be the trouble maker, and he never seems to suspect that she's trying to sneak out of the house. This father acts so naive and irresponsible. Only after Zane wants to take Cleo's sister home does her father show up. He then blames what happened on Cleo. While I'm watching this, I'm thinking, &#34;Hello, dad get off your butt, and watch your teenage kids.&#34; I know this show's main focus is supposed to be on Cleo, Bella, and Rikki; but the other characters need to be developed enough that they actually interact with the main characters instead of take up space, leave the viewer confused, or annoyed with what's being said and done. Seasons 1 and 2 were not perfect, but they were more enjoyable to watch."
1,"It's OK.  If you want to relax and have some funs over the weekend.  After watching it, you won't remember its contents very soon."
1,"The overview of Scotland's extraordinary history could be better. The pace was too fast, with a presumption that we already had some knowledge of the area.  Also, the sound quality was not up to par. Could barely hear it even when adding an outside speaker. However, the photography was fine, hence the rating."
1,very graffick but intersting
1,Very intriguing characters and great writing Awesome series!
1,"Well photographed, easy to watch, but not a comprehensive look at the destinations.  I would have liked a but more 'touristy' stuff."
1,"A really stirring story, one I'd never heard before. The brave boys who flocked to Israel's defense in 1948 have gotten their tale finally told. I'll never get over the irony of seeing Jewish pilots fighting for Israel in Nazi Bf-109 fighters, while the Egyptians and other Arabs flew Spitfires..."
1,Very nice and cleen.  Get tired of blood and guts!!!
1,good light entertainment with a refreshing twist... a beautiful woman who respects herself enough to set the moral bar high and her boundaries strong.  She gives this man a chance to value her at her worth.
1,"Loved the first season, but each season seems to go slower and slower. The plot is also getting weird. I'll still watch it anyway."
1,I look forward to the next series in this mystery.
1,Really great season.
1,great show
1,"This is a great season. Action packed and never dull, always entertaining and full of good content."
0,"it never fails, part way thru an espode I get a lost connection and have to restart.  Is the problem my tv or Amazon.  I also have Netflix and no problems.  What's up?"
1,It's so hard these days to find a good thought provoking movie that we can watch with the grandkids. Little Boy does not contain profanity nor does it  pander to the inclusion of &#34;political correctness&#34; which is why we enjoyed it so much.  Wish they would make more movies like this.
1,My kids and I love Creative Galaxy.
1,Love this series!!
1,"Such a cute show, one from my childhood and I'm happy my little guys enjoy it too."
0,"Terrible. I love Kevin Smith's work, but this was a ski tone shy of a Kanye West being a gay fish, joke."
1,Awesome concept. Intriguing. Way too long.
1,Great story and actors.
1,Very real world skills demonstrated. Great plot.
0,I could not finish this &#34;documentary&#34;. This has got to be one of the poorest documentaries I have ever tried to watch and listen to. The first reason is the poor quality of the making of it. I wish I did not have to give it a star rating at all.
1,"Amazing, full of actions!"
1,This is great and in depth.... when i get tired of hearing the same crap about WWII; this is something more!
1,"If you like a nice, well acted movie, you should enjoy this one."
1,Cool show
1,Great show
1,Love the books...love the show!
1,Romantic and lovely!
1,"I do enjoy the show, but Aaron Sorkin sure does like the F-word...he needs to get over that.  I've only watched half of the first season but it is also curious how Jeff Daniels' character keeps touting the fact that he is a republican, but it's unclear why.  He seems to have it in for republicans but not democrats...I think he could be a little more even handed :)  But it is interesting the way the use actual news events in the stories."
1,"Love Tom Selic all the cast is great and the story line beleavable , can't wait for the fall season to begin"
1,"Loved this classical a child. Watched it with my son and he loved it, too."
1,"I liked this movie. It tells the story of Winston Churchill as  quite a &#34;has been&#34; politician, but who seeks out information on Germany's build up of power and rouses the nation to the danger of Hitler and his army.  Albert Finney did a good job on his portrayal of Churchill and Vanessa Redgrave added much strength and passion as his wife as she struggled to live a normal life with him."
1,I have seen several movies and documentaries on JAcke Robison but I like this one a great deal.  Since it was done during his lifetime he appears in this movie as himself.  Great flick
0,"did not watch all, too slow for me."
1,Love this SciFi series.  Lots if twist and turns.
1,Great to catch up
1,Best ending to a series ever!!!
1,Love all these actors!
1,This is actually a pretty fun show.  I was just sorry it was only 6 episodes.  Looking forward to more.
1,"Great show - grabbed me from the first episode. Lot's of plot dynamics with the relationship between Elizabeth and Phillip, the FBI neighbor, the handler.  Good stuff."
1,Amazing series. It was a nice follow up to the original.
1,Good!
1,"If your life seems empty and has been spent largely in a state of hopeless futility, then this is the movie for you.  The female protagonist may make you feel lucky in comparison.  If not, then please accept my condolences.  I was sucked into it because it was about Sweden and I am a Swedo-phile."
1,"I loved seeing young Frank Sinatra and Gloria DeHaven is good too - it's worth watching for the singing. As a remake of Room Service though, it's just impossible to be as good as the Marx Brothers."
1,"I have watched this several years ago, enjoyed it again."
1,"I'm already invested so I'll stay tuned in, but there is a major drop-off from the tension/suspense that existed in the first season. The relationships during season one seemed more established and less thrown together or forced than this time around. Visually the show is as sharp and well shot as season 1 and the way they seamlessly depict amazing future technology without it distracting from the story is impressive."
1,Loved the first episode. Can't wait for the entire season
1,Excellent! My child loves these shows.i will purchase more once they become available.
1,grandkids love it!
1,Worthy
0,I have tried to watch this several times but it was just boring.
1,"I loved it I can't wait for the second season !  This has become one of my favorite shows ! The acting is great !  It's a true classic like, Pride & Prejudice or classic like Gone with the wind then"
1,"Action,humor and great writing."
1,Just okay.
1,"They are good but they are simply lectures.  Not very flamboyant.  But they are factual, provide accurate information and one can learn quite a bit.  I'm going through a bit at a time.  So far I'm satisfied."
1,Super cool
1,"This film is well worth a look.   Today I watched Harry Potter and the Sorcererâ€™s Stone again.It is a great movies. Forget When I was watch it movies in the first time,maybe in junior high school.Iâ€™m really like this book ,I liked everything if it  about magic.   This movies is good for family watching together.It is really fun movies and it told so many clues about the next movies,such as huge three-headed dog, Gringotts Wizarding Bank and Professor Quirrell. This all about a person Voldemort.At last,Voldemort left Quirrell to die and is likely to return by some other means.The Stone has now been destroyed.The school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys' for the summer holiday but does not tell them that under-age wizards are forbidden to use magic outside of Hogwarts.Ron and Hermione will be make friend with harry.They will go adventure  together.   Evil will never overcome the victory. Movies has a very good ending raises department of the next performance.I can't stop imagine scene about harry when he returned his uncleâ€™s home and use magic."
1,"Smart, funny and wildly entertaining for kids and adults alike."
1,It's OK. It has it's funny moments.
1,Some funny parts.  Lots of profanity and gross sexual and racial humor.  All in all a nice story with the previously mentioned baggage.
1,Showed the behind the scenes way the holocaust snowballed into a catastrophic disaster.
1,great to be able to watch the series all in a row....loved it.
1,Ok
0,"Balls, scrotum, mind-numbing dialog, boring characters, balls, scrotum. There. I just saved you 2 hours."
1,"Funny, preschool cartoon w/out words. Child can tell you the story."
1,Love old movies.  No cussing.
1,Very funny!
0,I just couldn't get into the show. I hated or was indifferent to all the characters. After 6 episodes I gave up. They are all shallow douches who like weed and girls but lack the brain power for any deeper thought.
1,I love moral delimma TV shows & movies so in that regard it was wonderful. But it is also disturbing on many levels. This movie expanded my consciousness and I find myself reflecting on it often.  It's haunting in that way.
1,"Very good series , we enjoyed it very much ."
0,"Just not that interesting, especially relative to the Pilot of TWD.  May give the second episode a chance."
0,Waist of time.
1,This one of the best shows HBO has done.
1,"Not as eventful as the first four, adds new characters, new relationships. Worth a watch if your a fan, just slows down a bit"
1,It was a pretty good movie but could have done without the gratuitous profanity! Why was that even necessary???
0,"Good cast, funny at first. Too far...Turned it off"
1,Good show!
1,Great scripts of great stories executed with great acting.
1,heart felt depictions of your neighbors
1,"Surprisingly good. I've seen a number of films with Aaron Eckhart in a starring or supporting role. Most to the movies have benn pretty good but even in the poor ones like &#34;I, Frankenstein&#34;, Eckhart has been good.<br /><br />He is sometimes called by commenters - a &#34;poor man's Liam Neesom'. But that's not fair. Before 'Taken' Neesom was in approximately the same career place that Eckhart is now. One lucky hit and Neesom is a big star. That could happen to Eckhart too.<br /><br />But alas this film while good isn't the kind that is likely to transform Eckhart's career.  We had never seen Neesom play an action hero and that role fit him remarkably well. But the ex-CIA that Eckhart plays here is something he has done many times before. It's right in his wheelhouse."
1,One of the best kid shows ever Disney really nailed it with this mystery show that is funny for kids and adults I love it and the characters are crazy funny and weird hope this show never dies
1,It was a fun movie to watch
1,Anything with Cynthia Rothrock in it is a must see for me.
1,Good story but the film quality is a little rough like many films from 30's. Bette Davis only has a supporting role but it's still nice to see her at a very young age. It did pull me in as I began to care more for the fate of the characters.
1,Addictive!
1,Good movie
1,Worth watching again.
1,Loved it
1,The Best!  You can't get better than this!  Like a dirty Seinfeld.  Very funny; I've watched multiple episodes over and over again.
1,It was good. I would recommend
1,Funny yet formulaic
1,"If you like motorcycles, especially classics and cafe racers, you'll love this show."
1,"Awesome, I wish they would bring it back to television."
1,Classic! Simple.
1,Good storry
1,Was a okay movie
1,"I love this show! The characters are so believable, and so lovable. At first, you think they could be the people next door- nice, plain folks. But then, they keep finding more skeletons in their tidy closets, and their simple lives become more and more complicated. I think this is one of the best series on TV. Superb acting, rich plot, clever dialogue. It's wonderful theater. I just hope there will be more!"
1,"Truly, something for the entire family.  Birth scenes and all."
1,"nothing new, just a simple, heartwarming film with some good upbeat music.  good for smiles."
1,My son loves this show!!
0,"I knew from the preview what this was going to be, but I was tricked by all the reviews into believing that this would actually have something worthwhile and interesting. This movie was terrible. If you are a lonely, intellectual or psuedo-intellectual, who dreams of a silent, androgynous-looking sex machine you can abuse emotionally to get back at all the women who rejected you, then this movie will probably be very thought-provoking (and by thought-provoking, I just mean fantasy-fulfilling). If you enjoyed this, I recommend that you learn to love and accept yourself (as you are, not as the God-like, rich, &#34;brilliant&#34;, weirdo that you dream of being) and forgive the women who were mean to you. Good luck to all who enjoyed this movie. I sincerely hope you find peace and true happiness, my friends."
1,Love love loved this! Would highly recommend to friends!
0,"The scenes are too short and dont explain what is happening. The actors aren't bad, but the writing is just terrible. I cant put my finger on what made it so terrible.<br /><br />I give two stars because the actors were decent and they stuck to the book for 95 percent of the movie."
0,Not so good
0,"I want the ten minutes back I wasted seeing what the show was about, I think my eyes tried to vomit from disgust"
1,Great movie! Loved the plot and the acting.
1,Fantastic series - nearly impossible to stop watching once get started.  Perfect mix of humor and detailed exploration of the characters.
1,Great movie!!!  Highly recommend!
1,One of the best pictures of all time. Never tire of viewing this film. Outstanding dialogue and acting.
1,"Loved it!!! Giovanni Ribisi is stellar, supported by a great cast.  Come on Amazon, bring it on!!!"
1,Great series!
1,Awesome series!
1,"A truthful look at the impossible facing public defenders. They lack money, and bargaining chips and also face distain of judges. However storyline concerning actors is quite lame. One gives the office 3 million dollars, another adopts a clients baby. Too bad the writers didn't have the conviction to emphasize courtroom drama."
1,Terrific show!
1,"Very interesting, loved learning about how highly intelligent and social killer whales are..amazing creatures that belong in the wild."
1,enjoyable
1,I'm absolutely love Harry Potter and this movie was great.
1,great
1,"Quality was comparable to 480p, movie was well done."
0,It was ok
0,My 2 year old wants to watch this program but it's not really for her. It doesn't hold her interest like the short formatted shows.
0,Lame.
1,The story and the History of King Francis and Mary Queen of Scots is riveting. The acting superior and the scenic beauty is over powering.
1,"Great movie, great acting, amazing graphics"
1,Exciting and fast-paced entertainment.
0,To slow
1,Not as funny as the first.  However I recommend it
1,Sure is better than reg TV programming this summer.
1,great as all W&G are
1,This movie is timeless and very fun to watch with teens/tweens that are just learning the history of our nation during the 1900s.
1,"Not a terrible thriller. Some decent acting and special effects. At the same time, not something I need to watch again."
1,ok movie.better than I thought it would be.
1,Neil Simon is great.  Jack Lemon and Walter Marhaugh are the best team
1,Thoroughly enjoyed this series. Great cast and content. Into the 2nd season now.
1,Easy to relate to their message

1,Great
1,Wonderful TV though heavy on violence. Not for little ones.
1,Addicting. Hoping for another season.
1,we liked both part I and part 2. Livia was made to look like she wasn't as bad as she really was.  It was good for history which we like.
1,Loved the sound track. Long time ago
1,This was too funny.  I saw it twice in the theater and once on line.  I laughed every time.  I think it is a good tribute to the original work!
1,My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie.  It's a great reminder of the huge price already paid by our Lord Jesus Christ for whosoever believes in him.
1,good
0,Awful  Not  funny at all.
1,"Not sure I fully understood the Directors meaning though I think it was about how disconnected we have all become from each other given so much computer &#34;technology&#34;. Odd that, because I was streaming the film..."
1,Interesting Brit. Detective story with a twist. Sometimes the Brit dialect needs rethinking .  I generally use closed captions on these . Otherwise a compelling and interesting story.
1,Hilarious!
1,Great show.
1,We adore this show.  Very family friendly and all my kids like to watch too!
1,"Great, informative and educational. Brian Green is awesome in explaining various theories..."
1,Educational without being condescending or boring. Fun show!
0,"What a muddled mess of a movie! Beautiful production design could not save a terrible, convoluted story. Mila Kunis is wasted here."
1,need more black & white shows
1,"Wonderful show! Interesting , true human interest topics well handled, well acted and lovely filming."
1,Wonderful show!It's so informative and fun.
1,"Still miss Espozito, but a solid season"

1,what a great ride
0,Waste of time!!!  Has been taken of the Watch List and will never return.

1,"Amazing show for all ages!!! 18 month old, 10 year old and I (30-something) love this show! Not all episodes are as interesting to us but all seem to strike a nice balance between education and entertainment. We love the aircraft carrier episode. The kids hosting the show are really talented and are so lucky to experience all these amazing adventures - inspiring!"
1,Great movie!
1,It was too campy and old English. It was racist times when they still called it darkest Africa I couldnt finish the movie. The original Fay Ray was beautiful. This Ray Fay wasnt even handsome.
1,Really good movie

1,"Incredible writing and directing. This is what television should be, we are totally addicted!!!"
1,"continuation of  season 1, which was also good."
1,Its a twister
1,Finished Season 2 and enjoying Season 3. Excellent acting Excellent show
0,Creepy story not worth the time.
1,"Very realistic. The characters are beautifully portrayed by obviously talented actors. The set is fantastic. While I do not necessarily agree with all of Aaron Sorkin's political views, his writing is poignant and stirs the emotions. I do find it somewhat unrealistic, however, that the news anchor is able to have so many obscure facts so readily available in his memory and at his fingertips to spout in interviews with people promoting views contrary to his own. That said, there are many times my emotions are stirred deeply by the plot and by the characters' reactions to the super-important news stories of the day."
0,Blegh. What a let down.  Dull.  Seems as though they could have done so much more with it.  And why was the one girl using a shell compact as a reading device?  It was like the director was trying to be &#34;artsy and different&#34; but just ended up with a weak film.
1,I like it. Good actors from breaking bad and the left overs.
1,"Pretty funny movie, but little slow at times."
1,Awesome movie!
1,Enjoyed this but not as much as season 1 & 2.

1,One of my all time favorite movies.
1,Seen this movie at least 5 times.  Love it every time!
1,"Would I watch this again? Yes, but only to FF to watch Channing Tatum dance solo. A bit slow and the leading actress is painful to watch. Her acting is just all together bad...I really wanted to like this movie."
1,"Where it all started.  A bit dated production being over 30 years old, but still excellent series."
1,"Great photography, limited story line."

1,thought  provoking
1,I could watch this show a million times and still love it!
0,"Too slick, too superficial. James Bond MD. It may be successful at what it's trying to do, but I couldn't watch it."
1,Great movie takes me back to that time!
1,Hilarious!!
1,One of the best action adventure TV series I have ever seen if you don't mind all the explicit sex scenes mixed in...
1,Great drama
1,"This a lets-get-on-the road inter-generational movie.  YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE BECAUSE THERE IS DEPTH! Cass the Doctor who has a career, a beautiful home in Winnipeg and a wonderful doggie,Winston.  Dylan, a young inappropriate-bohemium type with a belief she sensitive-incredible writer. anything else that I would offer now would be &#34;SPOILER ALERT&#34;.  My husband and I watch all films and TV that Richard Dreyfuss appears in; however, Tatiana Maslany, is an actor to watch.  That said, this should be a review to help you rent and develop your opinion of the movie."
1,Kids loved it!
1,Well put together.PBS is a good cause to support
1,Interesting characters.  Compelling story.
1,"The show is full of twists, turns and excitement."
1,Can't stop watching it.  I am about to run out of seasons.
1,Just as good if not better the second time around.
1,Fun and exciting. An entertaining movie.
1,Amazing miniseries. One of the best ever made.
1,my grandchildren love this show and they want me to watch it with them and i enjoyed it too.  entertaining and educational.
1,"I had a little trouble following the conversation at times, but the story was interesting, and views of the outback were great.  Too long."
0,Had &#34;English&#34; as the subtitle.  Never got past the first 5 minutes.
1,I read Connelly's books and thought Bosch was portrayed very true to the stories. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and can't wait for the next season!
1,All I know my daughters 7 and 3 love the show...
1,"Cheers is so fun to watch!!  Great cast, great lines, and a great place to have . . . a bar where everyone knows your name and you know everyone as well!!!"

1,Good movie
1,Entertaining as usual.
1,My baby girl LOVES this show...

1,Great show!
1,"Love this movie!  Those bears are so stinking cute!  Me and my (adult) BF watched it, and it was so cute!"
1,"Kids love it!  It's a bit sad for adults, but my kids think it's hilarious!"
1,ðŸ˜œ
1,Perfect Netflix doesn't have then but prime does
1,Great movie. Loved it.
1,Awesome movie
1,Great show!!!!!!
1,"While  in agreement  this is not one of Cameron Crowe's strongest efforts, it is far from being a bad film.  I personally believe sometimes when an A-list talent like Mr. Crowe  comes out with a highly anticipated movie, that the bar  for the critics and the audience is already somewhat higher from the outset.  So, I believe the playing field is not quite level from the outset when reviewing the film compared with other films of the same ilk.<br /> So, what I believe is a film that is worthwhile and enjoyable has been simply knit picked to death, from what was considered questionable casting of the Emma stone character to the pace of the movie etc.  The bottom line is, this film was enjoyable, well acted and worthy of an audience.<br /> It is simply a fun, lighthearted  well directed romance film that will likely not disappoint 80% of the people that give it a shot. Aloha!"
1,Lot of high profile action.
0,"I enjoyed the stories and the setting. However, the actor who played the Vicar always walked around with his head down, looking like a sad sacks. I would think a Vicar would be able to express himself and deal with people. This dude can't EVER express himself to anyone. Maybe with another actor who played the role differently, the show would have been more enjoyable."
1,Have shared it with many friends. Fascinating topic.
1,Nothing extra exciting about this one.
0,I like Ben Stiller and expected more from the other actors as well. It put me to sleep.
1,It was beautiful.
1,Hilarious and Timeless.
1,Enjoyed the banter between the main characters over the high body count. The overall story this time wasn't as good as previous series.
1,"All seasons are cult-classics.  Rod Serling brought us many science fiction episodes, but also episodes that bring to light the very real issues of the day, and of all time.  Many of the episodes of Twilight Zone will always be relevant, as long as humans are relevant, and still exist.<br /><br />Bravo Mr. Sterling, bravo!"
1,"Suprising, not predictable. Keeps you entertained!"
1,"My second time watching this film, so I must find it to be a terrific movie.  Highly recommended."
1,When will season six be free?
1,"For me, science fiction requires a plausible scenario.  This movie did have a good plot.  A purpose behind the mayhem.  And I enjoyed the movie very much."
1,Really like this type of programming
1,"Beautiful story, scenery, and acting."
0,Amateurish and not worth the time!
1,I loved this show as a kid and now my kids do too!
0,so slow..could barely stand first show.
1,"Meh. Kids love it, but I can't watch it."
1,Unusual mystery...drama.  little twists and turns..<br />Multiple plots.
0,Meh
1,Love it now need to have season 6 and 7 for free please :) so I can finish the show up!

0,Ugh...
1,Great movie for dog loving kids
1,Good show
1,Very good
1,Love the series overall
1,"Love the way the story is told, Bosch is awesome and they defiantly got the rite actor to play this role. He sells it, great acting."
1,"It is very well written. It is very well acted. It is very funny. The characters ring true. However, it is just for adults due to not infrequent explicit and graphic sexual content and references. If you have children you should not allow them to watch it.  I would not want to watch this with my daughter who is 21. However, I very much enjoyed watching it on my own. Overall, I highly recommend it."
1,Awesome show - very sad that it only has one season.
0,Script lacking any substance. Stupid use of talents.
1,"Mostly family friendly show with lots of action, twists and turns. Good acting and story lines. Keeps you wondering what's coming next. It tempts you to binge on it."
1,It was a better than expected movie.  I admit i was not expecting a lot and was pleasantly surprised with the acting as well as the story line.  Worth a look for sure.
1,Interesting story with many twists and turns.
1,Excellent Drama.  I was hooked after the first episode!  Each episode drew me deeper and deeper into the story.  There are so many great story lines and twists and turns.  I wish there were more than 2 seasons to watch!!
1,Amazing show. I can't believe it hasn't gotten any Emmy nominations.
1,"Well done,seems like an honest show of what it is like to be a big city lawyer,well done"
1,"so funny, better the The first, I pray for a trilogy, dude we're gonna make America happen!!!!!!!!  Loved it<br />-Nuff said"
1,I loved the story and I loved the music. I love fairytales!!!

1,Still great.
1,Excellent
1,Very educational and informative
0,"Too dark ,not that good action"
1,Just wonderful.
1,good movie
1,Love it!
1,"My son has watched the same episode over and over. Wish there were more, they are the perfect amount of time."
1,Almost as good as Inspector Morse!
1,"If you like Adam Sandberg in Hot Rod, you will enjoy Adventures of Power.  There is a ridiculous amount of star power in this film, and the scenes are great.  Really funny if you are musically inclined, especially so if you are a fan of drums.  Power is a unique young man, a young man who still hears the heartbeat of his mother, and feels the need to rock-out and air-drum every chance he gets.  Power has a difficult time fitting in, so goes on a fantastic journey to find a mentor, and finds an equally unique love along the way, a def woman who can feel the music when he is air-drumming.  Along the way, we see how Power's passion and proclivities effect the people in his life."
1,"Just as good as season one, but I don't know what they could do to do a third season."
1,Excellent.
1,great movie!!!!
1,Very entertaining.
1,Reminded me of there will be blood
1,great movie

1,I love period pieces! This movie was done very well.
1,An amazing show. I love it!
1,Excellent  movie
0,Dumb
1,"Best show ever. Great acting and writing. You are so drawn to these characters that you will feel like you are part of the family, upstairs or downstairs."
1,Cute
1,"A wonderful time capsule of the mid-century music industry and the big personalities that defined it.  The ups and downs between Rick Hall, his studio bands and Jerry Wexler are a bit hard to follow, but this history is well documented elsewhere.  What comes through are the people and the extraordinary place that somehow produced great music."
1,God is good this is a powerful lesson for all young ladies.
1,Great
1,We live Veggietales!
1,"If your into Fast n Furious, this is a must buy. Loved it!!!!"
1,"Amusing story with a certain appeal. The actors are a very capable bunch. The story has an appeal to gay and non gay viewing audience members. The late Mr. Reborn was a very good, believable character actor."
1,"Watched movie shortly after reading book. Movie well crafted, but book better. Would have liked movie more if I had not just read book."
1,ok
1,Great plot with good acting. definitely worth watching especially if you like war movies.
1,"Come for the comedy, stay for the warmth! Fascinating to see Rob Delaney grow from twitter wit to stand up to damn good comic actor. Sharon O'Horgan also terrific and the duo wrote and produced as well as star. It's a slice of life about two mismatched mid-lifers who face an across-the-pond crisis with humor and tenacity and more than a little genuine love and affection. Only six episodes, so it's a long movie that's well worth your time!"
1,This is one of my favorites  I have watched it on PBS for several yeras now  I try not to miss any of the shows.  Love it
1,great
1,Giovanni makes every show better!
1,Very real issues. Lena is great.
1,Great series.  Had me hooked from episode one.
1,"Works as an absurdist/dark comedy, but don't believe that is is factual. The source story is a very different tale.<br />By far the least grating Michael Bay offering available."
1,"great show, good characters slow development but good performances outweigh everything else"
1,Watched it with my 8 year old daughter.  Excellent show.  The way in which the soccer and life messages intertwine is why we encourage our kids to play soccer.
1,"Very, very well done. Jeffrey Tambor deserves an Emmy!"
1,"This will definitely get your heart pounding and the sweat pouring! She uses 3 lb weights but if that's too easy, just up the weights. I used anywhere from 3 to 20 lb weights depending on how much I wanted to push. 30 day shred is my JAM but this one week shred is so great for missing it up or go if yourself a real push."
1,The story has a couple of twists and a surprise ending.
1,Could have done without all the hipster dorks confessing their love for the sauce. Somewhat interesting though.
1,Great series!
1,TWO MEN IN TOWN  HAS A GOOD  STORY LINE . FOREST WHITAKER PLAYED HIS ROLE  WELL. I ENJOYED THE MOVIE.
0,Not what I expected
1,"my daughter loves this movie, she is 6 and recognizes a lot of the people from various shows she watches!"
0,Crappiest World War two movie I have ever seen
1,The best writing I've seen in a long time. This show is fantastic and intelligent. Don't miss it.
1,What
1,Suspense
1,Loved this show! Hope to see more of it!
1,Interesting visually - in a very dark black and white.  Not much story :-/  More of an ambiance
1,Great movie.
1,Well done
1,The movie was different from the original but good
1,just watch it already....simply the best
0,Eh
0,Not what I expected
1,it was ok not great.
1,I have watched the last two seasons and was anticipating the third season when DISH network lost the programming. Thank you Amazon for having this available. If Amazon carried the other programming I watch I would cancel my DISH
1,Perhaps not far to vote just yet.  Lost interest when violence started.  Very slow thus far though.  I will continue and report again
1,Great movie.
1,"Awesome movie, very inspirational."
1,Great. Carries on tradition of franchise.
1,COOL GROOVY AND FAROUT
0,Horrible
1,My third favorite werewolf movie after American Werewolf in London and the Howling.
1,Love this series.
1,Ok. A lot of fiddle music.
1,This is one incredible cartoon show. It teaches good lessons to children such as in the &#34;Hooky&#34; episode it teaches not to give into temptations. It's funny and has great animation. I would recommend it for any age.
1,Good movie
1,Very funny! Not at all what I expected.
1,A little too slow for my liking
1,Loved it.
1,Best series. So wonderful to see again after all these years.
1,Love it.  Cleverly written and I've loved Giovanni Ribisi since Friends. I'm impatiently awaiting more episodes!
0,Not what we thought it would be.
1,Like the Danish one better
1,"We enjoyed this movie but it was definitely a surprise. Not the funny, lightweight kind of movie you normally expect  from SNL alums.  Attempted suicide, emotional baggage from childhood, troubled marriage - It is a bit dark but well written and performed."
1,It was very funny!
1,"The series continues to be addictive, if you can put up with the blatant inconsistencies in the plot and the bizarre timing of the events."
1,"Family friendly.  Acting was good, but some of the storyline was overly far-fetched.  It's unlikely that someone who owned a B&B on that much property wouldn't already have been using the property for &#34;events&#34; and such.  The &#34;mean girl&#34; aspect (Zuniga) was over-written; who would accost a property owner with an offer to buy during a funeral, etc.  Still, Zuniga did the best she could with what she was given.  It all comes out well in the end, so if you want a family friendly story that has a happy ending, this might be for you."
1,Great movie worth watching.
1,This was a movie that kept you wondering what was coming next
1,"Cute as a button, smart writing and acting for her character, with a teeny-bopper back drop and adult story lines."
1,One of the best series I have ever watched. Toni Collette is outstanding in this role!
1,love it
1,Bermuda is five stars any day ANY way
1,There should be college courses to study and analyze SpongeBob episodes.
1,"It's sad that they have not continued filming more seasons! Very relaxing, never boring!"
1,Fun watching with enough drama to it interesting. Watched seasons 1 and 2 and anxious for season 3 to be free.
1,Great movie
1,"Excellent series, great storyline."
1,Never gets old!!!!!!
1,Good flick.  I was entertained.
1,Great show
1,My wife and I find this to be laugh out loud funny.<br />... and I am a hard person to even get a smil out of
1,Well done series
1,A surprisingly good series. Well written and well acted. Good use of actual clips.
0,Not good! Pilot needs to be captivating from the get go and build on it. Instead boring story of a disfunctional family no one cares about with a little bit of action
1,"I am not usually a fan of sequels; however, Furious 7 was really good and is easily the best in the series. This is a movie worth watching!"
1,Great
1,scary
1,Tough to bead Detective Sipowicz and his rollercoaster emotions
1,Excellent series.  Hard not to keep watching episodes back to back.
1,Fractals episode was very interesting!
0,"the movie look good, keep me interested, unlucky me started to watch it too late at night and felt asleep, by the time i tried to finish it the next day my rental period was over. So i cant tell if was good or not since i missed probably half of the movie and the ending. It was an expensive rental I think rentals period should be a bit longer if movies are gonna cost that much. very disappointed."
1,Action packed  interesting ending
1,It turned out to be a good season to binge watch.
1,Funny and cute
1,vety good movir
1,"awesome series finale, sorry to see it go"
1,Awesome movie. Lots of action!
1,Must watch!!
1,"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967. They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's. Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,Wow! No one can deny God's hand in the survival of His people! It is a nation built on faith. Thank you volunteers for your part in preserving the promised land in the right hands.
1,"One of the best TV dramas Ive seen in a very long while. As someone who worked in TV and Radio, I found it authentic and stimulating."
1,Excellent and funny
1,"Great movie,  awesome story line"
1,Love this show !!!!!
1,LOVE This series!!! so much fun definitely not a kid show. the music is fun the drama is ehh-ok
1,Its a great show...I am not ready for it to end.
1,Good movie
1,Good acting and a reasonable story-  entertainment but not outstanding
1,"Very funny, episodes 4 & 5 are just episodes 1 & 2 I think the Amazon streaming is messed up"
1,Excellent.
1,Fun movie.
1,Second time around it's even better.
1,LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie!!! It's a must see!
1,Great!
1,Great show!
1,Fabulous - the acting - the cast - the writing - it doesn't get any better than this.
1,"The writing and story line of this movie was the best I've ever seen in a children's movie. This film was so much more than your average kids movie. It brought a mixture of culture, humor, lessons, and emotion, that so many movies are missing in present day films. Fantastic movie for all ages."
1,Meh.
1,Seen it 100+ times... Every movie by Frank Capra is incredible... Thanks for having this EXCELLENT movie on Prime!
1,Reciting!!!! Loved it can't wait till season 3 is released by amazon
1,My daughter loves Daniel Tiger. He has made for many enjoyable road trips that without him wouldn't have gone so well.
1,The only negative I can see is most men of Gary Cooper's age would stay away from girls of Audrey's age. It makes it especially charming that he cant seem to help himself.
0,Too much talking not enough action.
0,Written for 12  year olds.
1,Pretty good series but the cursing is way over the top.  I'm no saint but it reminds me of watching Scarface where the F bomb is dropped every sentence. I think on average every third line of the actors is probably laced with profanity.  After 2 episodes I became numb to it.  Is that good or bad?  LOL!
1,"Okay, but seems to be running out of a story line."
1,This movie is very funny...makes you wonder if this is how &#34;Grimm's Fairytales&#34; started...it fooled me at the end...you must watch it...I'm not telling...LOL
1,Very good!
1,Loved it and Scott Eastwood is a gorgeous man!
1,Wow. Just wow !! This show leaves me speechless every single time !! A work of art !!!
1,"This was a great video. I liked seeing the story of how the Ringling Brothers got started, and how much work goes into creating a circus. I would recommend this video."
1,Incredibly riveting account of the secret meeting which took place to discuss the &#34;Final Solution&#34; between the heads of the Nazi party who would be willing participants in the wholesale slaughter of Jews and anyone else the Nazis felt were not worthy of the perfect German society that was meant to last a thousand years. It is very chilling the way they are discussing something with such lack of concern for human life. An all star cast. Really worth watching.
1,"I am surprised at how I have missed out on viewing the many Anime movies there are. Song of the Sea is another well written, eye-catching movie, that is sure to delight the child in everyone. I think this is a wonderful movie. It is a must see to put on your wishlist to view."
1,One of the best movies ever made!
1,"Extant is an interesting series that is clearly finding it's way during season 1. There is a lot of baseline information that was presented showing what picture they are trying to develop. Some of the actors are a bit weaker than others - likely something that will need to be resolved over time. If you are watching for the sci-fi / action drama this is a good series, if you are watching for deep character development it's a bit weak."
1,This show has me wanting to move to the wilderness. Fav characters are Tom and the Marty
1,I love it.
1,"I liked the show. It seems interesting, fresh and new. I have never seen a show with these kind of storylines. I am looking forward to more episodes. I love Giovanni Ribisi in this role. This is the show Amazon should pick up."
1,Good Movie!
0,"Love laugh tracks, you'll love this show."
1,"When I first started watching True Blood ... I almost gave up on it.  Just a little slow starting.  But if you hang in there, you will be pleased with how the plots develop and the characters evolve.  I am not much into fantasy shows ... so I have to chuckle a bit that I have gotten hooked by a show about vampires, fairies, werewolves, and shape shifters."
1,Great Show!
1,"I'm enjoying this program. And look forward to each episode. My grandson (22) tells me the science fiction is flawed that viruses, bacteria, etc. do not live in space. Still, who cares, it is fun story with actors I enjoy."
1,I was disappointed
0,This one is a turkey. I want my money back
0,Not very funny
0,It was just ok
1,"EARLY PLOT SPOILER<br /><br />The best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?"
1,"Excellent show, but thought it was kind of slow moving."
1,"I was surprised that there was tax on top of the price.  When I order ON Demand through Comcast, I do not pay tax."
1,excellent old movie
1,My son watches the episodes over and over. Wish they would add some new ones ;) Would definitely recommend for anyone with a toddler through preschool aged little one.
1,Great concept...this should be made into a series!
1,good show
0,Not the best western I have ever seen.
1,So funny
1,"Fun, exciting, and a great view of the behind the season of the NY symphony orchestra."
1,"compelling, thought provoking, fast moving and beautiful."
1,"I will agree to the one starers that it has a slow reveal. However I also feel that too many people have a distorted sense of purpose and will not comprehend this movie. It is great to see CGI only used to support very incredible and prolific symbolism (not intended to depict something realistically- go see Marvel and DC comics for  that which I love as well). I don't want to give anything away like others have and I think you should avoid if you want the full effect of this movie. If you end up suffering through this movie because of my positive review, my apoligies. I am certain this movie is not understood by most."
1,"This yoga video series is quite possibly the best offered on Prime! It is well-produced, professional, and easy to follow. Not only does the series feature different types of yoga depending on your fitness goals, but it all shows how to go through the poses at a beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels. It is the next best thing to going to a yoga studio!"
1,"Loved it,  watching on PBS and on Prime."
1,I can wait to watch more.
1,Best
1,Can't wait for the next season!!!
1,Just a fun show to watch.
1,"Pleasant fantasy, nice to watch when your brain needs a rest with plots that have happy endings."

1,great. riveting
1,great classic movie. You'll never hear the banjo and not think of this movie again.

1,No comments.
1,decent movie.
0,didn't care for it.
1,Very well done look at all genres of popular music by city -- a kind of rock and roll hall of fame on a micro level. Fascinating for teenagers through senior citizens that love Rock. I would rate PG 13 for crude language).
1,Great show! Our whole family loves it.
0,Terrible movie in every way
1,So funny I watch every day and my granddaughter love it .
0,"Oh my goodness. It's like the writer/director/whatever for this piece of trash spent 10 minutes on the Internet--and 5 on /b/ before crapping out this script. Little to no understanding of anything of the Internet culture--spouting memes completely out-of-context with dialogue that is stilted and unnatural, boring characters and hiring Youtube 'celebrities'? Really? Please, skip this one."
0,Entertaining....but wait till tbs is running re runs.
0,"Smart, thoughtful entertainment!"
1,Great Story. How about them apples. Classic Line.
1,Lots of drama
1,Love Mac!
1,Awesome show!
1,"I was really disappointed that this movie did not come to theaters near me.  But I was happy that I could purchase it here at Amazon and download it right away (love that instant gratification).<br /><br />I did enjoy the story line, the gorgeous sets, locations, etc.<br /><br />I found that the audio for the movie really left something to be desired and character speech could be very difficult to hear."
1,Well done history of our Parks.  Makes you feel good about our country.
0,Boring
1,Some good performances with an uneven script. Melodramatic.
1,can't stop watching it.
1,"s*** animation, looks like this thing was old as dirt, was still cool i just wish there were somethign more up to date"
0,It was okay for a one time watch .<br />It's a slow paced movie
1,Just as good as I remember. Every episode.
1,Great movie if your into these kinds. It's not a low budget film which a lot of these kinds are. A great movie!
1,I loved it as a child & I think I enjoyed it even more now.
1,Excellent story.
0,to contrived<br />Good attempt to make a run at Woody Allen but falls way short
1,I usually get tired of series and don't finish watching them. The Good Wife has kept me interested so far. I am now on season 5. Great show!
1,It was an OK movie.
1,"My daughter loves this show! I love that the character figures her problems out, helps her friends and loved her family."
0,"The acting was good. It was the only good thing. The set was terrible, like a high school production. The lighting was bad, and the sound was bad.<br />I only got through it because I paid my money and I was determined.<br />I'm glad I didn't pay the price of admission at a movie theater."
1,Love the action of the stories and how all the characters play their roles so well.
1,Excellent. A well done look-back at the birth of Israel's air force.
0,Garbage - would give it negative stars if there were such options :)
1,"This is an intense and solid movie that was eclipsed by Jurassic Park and national news stories when it was released. It deserved more credit than it received and had it been released at a different time, it would have been a much bigger hit on the silver screen. This movie has awesome effects that are still good on a TV screen but are no comparison to how you would have felt in the movie theater with a huge screen. Even so, the movie kept us at the edge of our seats even on a little computer screen. The plot isn't like the Godzilla movies of old but actually makes sense in a scientific way as presented in this movie. It's a cliff hanger of a movie with characters you will like and characters you will want to smack. That, by the way, is a sign of a good movie when the acting is good enough to arouse emotions both good and bad. So grab the popcorn but go to the bathroom first because once this rocket ship of a movie takes off, you will hate to break the tension by hitting the pause button."
1,Gritty!
1,glued to view continually. Interesting that there is such a group in the UK that helps protect people against terrorist threats. They training is very intense with very few selected - a model for other countries.
1,"Covered broad range of emotional problems, the science behind why they occur and ways people get treatment."
1,Cool
1,Great series!
1,Great acting and story line.
1,"This is a very important movie, especially if you love animals and cats. I am going to send it to my vet in effort to get her to stop declawing."
0,"Even with some of the best of the old-time actors, this story creaks and is unimaginative. Furgettaboutit."
1,Best show ever! How did we miss this series on TV for all these years?
1,"Excellent series, enjoy every episode of good writing, great acting, and set against the beautiful backdrop and history of Oxford."
0,"Good plot poorly executed, good actors, bad direction.  The dialog was disjointed early in the movie, but got better towards the end."
1,It is different like a British comedy
1,A pretty thorough look at the life and how he got there of one of America's most beloved comedians.In the time allowed they cover his start and the many accomplishments he made up to the day he died. A good watch for those who want to remember Robin Williams and see how he became a treasured comedian and civic minded human being. Well worth the time to view.
1,Great show!! Historically accurate.
1,love this show....
1,The movie is well done.
1,It's ok for one time. Good actors but story line is boring.
1,Very good
1,"Who doesn't like Ruff?!  He has taught our family lots of science and math, too!"
1,A wonderful movie!!
1,Can't wait for MORE!
1,Better than I anticipated
1,This series is entertaining and keeps the characters from being boring by constantly changing how they react to diferent situations. It's nice to see the characters evolve into their roles as the program progresses.
1,Excellent movie.
1,"As a &#34;hobby&#34; farmer.........with a small garden and small flock of chickens, I totally enjoyed this film, and the people in it. I just wish it had been longer. ;-)"
1,TOO SLOW. Not what I hoped for.
1,"Another solid movie by Adam Carolla. Funny, charming, and entertaining."
1,Loved it. Hated my membership was over.
1,"Just love Robert Downy, Jr."
1,Droll humor at its best! Fabulous improv troupe seems to always pull off a funny and sometimes hilarious show.
1,Can't believe I waited this long to see the show.  Great quality TV!
1,so far so good. on episode 6
1,"Always good show, good people, good ideas, and great food!"
1,Great show. Highly recommended....just finished season 1. Moving on now.
0,This will be the same premise as the movie Taken with different characters and it doesn't even come close to the quality of Taken.
1,Loved it.
1,It was fun light entertainment.
1,It was enjoyable for the whole family.
1,very predictable
1,"I particularly liked the 'cello-playing scenes. Not only were they beautifully played, but they were masterworks as well represented as short segments can be. Also, somehow, the playing was not faked (as such scenes often are). I will have to watch the movie again to try and figure out how the scenes were photographed with the 'cello actually being played but seeming to show the actress doing the actual playing. Could it be that the actress was really a 'cellist? The story was wonderful, very convincing, and very inspiring!"
1,Amazing show couldn't stop watching!!
1,Was good not great
0,"Bizarre, creepy, and so unbelievable I couldn't suspend disbelief. Truly a waste of my time that I will never ever get back. I mean, who kidnaps a man (cutting off his ear)  and his son to force the woman to sing &#34;Blue Velvet&#34; at the night club and then perform BIZARRE sexual favors for him?  And what woman who is subjected to this really just wants to be smacked around and seduces at knife point the kid who was hiding in her closet?  STUPID ffilm."
1,"It's entertaining, the first season was probably the best of all of them"
1,A thoroughly enjoyable mini-series.  I think that anyone who liked the book will enjoy this show.
1,Very interesting drrama
1,I love this movie. It's about family and its a wonderful movie to watch with my son and nephew.
1,a classic that still holds up after all these years! I didn't realize how physical Kirk Douglas' role was! The special effects (for 1954) are really worth noting..
1,Rewatching--- this series holds up 14 years later
1,"I've loved Jemaine Clement since Flight of the Conchords, so it was great fun to see him in this movie that he also wrote. Very funny &#34;mockumentary&#34; about vampires living in modern day New Zealand. Of course I was waiting for Rhys Darby (Also from Flight) to make an appearance, and he did not disappoint! If you like vampires and droll humor, this movie is for you! Looking forward to watching it again with other friends who have seen it and love it!"
1,I love it.. Its a great show
1,I love movies that inspire people to be better.  I know in the full story more credit was given to God and their faith.  I do recommend.
1,Fast paced but an excellent movie.
1,Loved it!
0,Booooring! unless you are a total beginner this video is useless
1,This is a very compelling series.
1,I'm a huge SATC fan and was sad to have the series end - the movies just weren't as good as the series.  Season 6 had a lot of ups and downs - at times it seemed a bit rushed but overall it was great.  The last 2 episodes were the best!
1,Perfect movie for the whole family.
1,Son loves it. Great for kids!
0,waste of time
1,"I was surprised at the number of episodes I didn't remember, wish there was another season."
1,One of my favorite shows on television.
1,My 2 year old knows the names to most animals now. Its quite extraordinary. Diego has been a staple in our household for about 12 years now for each of our children.
1,I cannot wait for season 2!  These are talented actors and the show is quite engaging!!
1,So funny has a lot of Truth to it
1,I hope to see more of it.
1,I think this will be a awesome show!
1,If you are a fan of auto racing you will love this.
1,Thought it was okay.  Same sort of thing as the Jason Bourne movies.  If you like those this will be okay.
1,Another delightful Pixar short!  Grandson loved it - another one we watch over and over again!
1,Excellent!!
1,I love this standup and am happy to see an HD rental here!
1,Great movie!!
1,Deals well with the disgustingly fallen nature of man. An unquenchable lust for money and power. Acting and sets are spot-on.
1,"good yarn mostly.  some interesting action scenes, but some plot twists really strained my belief system.,..just sayin'"
1,"A revelation on what is possible with autism.  I heard Temple Grandin speak once, and this portrayal is well written and superbly acted. It is uplifting and I will watch it again and I will share it with many others."
1,Continuous laughs
1,Amazing story of survival of 3 WWII soldiers.
1,W/ good back story
0,worst season of all. the cases are just a backdrop now. There basically pointless. There is so many storylines running is hard to keep up. Especially since the first season just focused on nick.
1,"Info for Amazon: This came up while I was surfing Fire TV, I didn't know it was an Amazon pilot, I wasn't looking for children's shows, but the initial picture and brief description looked interesting, so I clicked. Yes, Amazon, your marketing strategy successfully triggered a sensory impulse response. I loved the show! Funny. Reminded me a little of the Incredibles; in animation style, values, and family/culture humor. Funny: &#34;your mom called my mom....&#34; Values: seeing her reflection in a window, she stops and says &#34;this isn't me&#34; and turns back.... I hope Amazon will make this series!"
1,A good clean show for adults. Has some good morals and the importance of family.
1,"Decent movie, good concept for a low budget film."
1,"Very good pilot, I hope to see more."
1,"hard to stop watching the show........just loved it, if it was not so expensive I would watch the next season!!!"
1,"The third and last season for Star Trek (TOS). Great stories, classic actors and acting. The original series is the best. These shows are fun, interesting, and they have the best storyline built into the relationships between the actors and actresses. You won't regret seeing these shows."
1,Loved it.
1,Very cute cartoons it totally caught my 4 years old daughter's attention
1,A great introduction for law school students on procedural rules.
1,Great Documentary. We need to have more people watch this movie
1,"Aaron Sorkin is the best, and The Newsroom is one of HIS best!  Great writing and a great cast. A show about how the Press is SUPPOSED to be"
1,Great series!<br />Tatiana is an unbelievable actress.<br />Wonder how long it takes to film an episode?
1,One of my favorite movies of all time.
1,great!
1,"This show was funnier than I expected. I don't usually watch romantic comedies, but I am glad I watched this one. The characters are well developed and great to watch."
1,Very solid acting performances throughout!
1,I saw in the theaters and now at home.  This is a haunting movie I will watch over and over.  It is not gory or gruesome just freaky and eerie in a jump-at-ya way
1,Sad to see it end just when the writers were getting into their stride.
1,"Excellent show..I am hooked, where is the rest of Season 1 ?!!!  :)"
0,not my favorite
1,Excellent story plot
1,Awesome
1,I just really like this show!  Smart writing with great characters!

1,Beautifully written and performed.
1,Great show

1,absolutely loved it! So glad to find this series on Amazon. I love my prime!
1,"Unique twist, very strong characters. Fascinating."
1,Love it!
1,I absolutely LOVE this show. The acting and story lines are wonderful.
1,Always a Barney fan... Both my 4 years old and 10 months old loved the music the colors the kids interaction. Very educational and fun to watch
1,Loved it and hope to see more!
0,Sam Jackson was the most NOT believable character in the movie . miscast is my guess but mad the movie overall was a great disappointment
1,Great movie!!!
1,"Good, cute show for preschoolers."
1,One of my all time favorite shows. Lead actress is beyond talented and a joy to watch. She's so good you forget it's one actress playing all these awesome characters. Can't recommend this show enough.
1,"Always been a classic!  Not very politically correct for the current day, however, so viewer beware."
1,Very confusing but the theater audience applauded at the end!
1,Such a great show!
0,I wasn't able to stream The Wire to determine if I liked it or not.
1,Season 3!!
0,Of you're a young boy then it's a perfect movie to make them feel super. But for an adulr..pretty silly.  I must have missed the place where it said it is for a lid.
1,Love the British Monarchy Series
1,Fantastic performances and beautiful setting.
1,One of my favorites!
1,I enjoyed the show. The female couple was just so obnoxious though. They belong on a show like real housewives of Anywhere.
1,"I am still watching, it over and over again!"
1,"I love this show and I am grateful that prime has it, as I lost this programming on my DISH. Thank you Amazon"
1,Could have been better if only we had captured those damn bridges!
1,I hope that they continue with the rest of the series of books.
1,We have watched the first 3 episodes and greatly enjoyed them!
1,Caught the first couple episodes when it aired then lost track of it started re watching it. Seems like a good show
0,So so
0,Interesting!
0,So predictable and boring.  This script was beneath both of these actors.  SO disappointing.
1,outstanding series!
1,Fantastic
1,didnt need the sex or bad words..other than that good story
1,"Decent movie, but needed to be longer to provide all the pieces needed to do justice to the story.  We felt like there were too many missing pieces."
1,"Good movie, and it's always interesting to watch a true story. Philly people will especially enjoy (:"
1,Great Series!
1,Ok movie
0,I did not watch the whole movie. Not the kind of mobie I like.
1,ok
1,"Funny, tongue in cheek adventure."
1,Each season just keeps going down the rabbit hole(s). In the very best of ways!
1,Really imaginative- a cautionary tale well acted and well produced.
1,"The opening music is perhaps the most exciting thing about the show.  The story line is mediocre and predictable and the acting is far from Shakespearean, but it is bearable and less smarmy than Next Generation."
1,Well worth watching!  As relevant today as when it was first aired.  Eerie how many of the gadgets on the Star Trek franchises have become reality.<br /><br />May you live long and prosper...
1,Touching and very true
1,Loved it. Has a little bit of everything.
1,very good story.  Interesting and of a subject that many have no knowledge of.
1,Good show. Needs less sex and more story.
1,When are the new episodes on?
1,The single most important movie of 1989.  Or any year ending in a 9.
1,Love it!
1,Because I love Maggie smith and really enjoy Kevin Kline. It started out slow but the development story and psychological line excellent
1,Love it
1,"Enjoyed,"
1,"Always enjoy Will Smith, (post prince), and this was a fun, eye appealing romp in 'sorta-good-bad-guy' unexpected love and &#34;are-you-kidding-me?&#34; tutorial for would be film-flam pick pocket wanna-be's.  Enjoyed, will watch again, perhaps purchase."
1,Entertaining so far!
1,Much like a Jason Bourne movie. Good action and acting.
1,love the show! Acting is great.
1,Fantastic story and the beginning of an amazing movement.
1,A great series with lots of action and a suspenseful plot.
1,It was cute for a four year old.
1,"Innovative science fiction movie with a fair amount of drama and tense moments. At times, the movie borrowed some elements from the classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, the movie plot didn't always hold together for me."
1,The book trilogy is obviously better but sure hope the movies come out for the second 2 books.  I found the movie to be a little disjointed.
0,"What a waste of time. Not funny, not interesting. Bad Bad Bad."
0,Wasn't that good only give it two stars!
1,best animation movie ever love it
1,Enjoyed this movie very much.  Good thrills and of course parts of it a bit unbelievable so manage your expectations.  If you are looking for entertainment this is a great movie!
1,I love love love this show. It ended way to soon.
1,Good movie.
1,Wonderful!
0,"Right after the first extraneous sex scene/homosexual scene, I gave up."
0,"Just don't, please."
1,Can't get enough! Great acting!
1,great
1,It's a dark and realistic 'drama' of what it must be like to get someone focusing on more than his/her addiction.<br />I really like Mr. Bratt and am impressed with his as well as the cast's nuance performance.
1,"I loved it the first time around and now I can learn all the trivia, more about the actors, mistakes, and go over the season in detail."
1,Very good.
1,This was one of the best series that I have seen on Amazon prime. The ending was quite shocking and I didn't see it coming. All of the actors were outstanding.
1,Super Great movie!!
0,"This show is absolutely obnoxious, but my toddler likes it.  There's no accounting for taste, though, because she also likes Dora the Explorer.<br /><br />Terrible things about this show: the cheap-looking animation, Bianca's voice that completely changes to an adult's when she sings a song, the entire &#34;Bob the teddy bear&#34; character, the word &#34;Wishenpoof&#34;.  Good things about this show: lessons about friendship, listening, etc.<br /><br />I'll keep steering her towards Peg + Cat...."
1,Storyline good but needs better editing. Too many pauses where none are needed. Excessive scenes that didn't add to the story. Some scenes were run together. The overall  premise of two very different people overcoming obstacles that keep them apart is a good one.
1,"I love these people!  It is so refreshing to see lovely people, each with their own journey, striving so hard to be accepting and loving of those that matter in their lives.  This is indeed a great example of our families these days.  Learning to put aside the differences and embrace the commonalities is the recipe to happiness.  We can all learn from their struggles and successes!  Thanks to the &#34;Stewart's and the Hamilton's&#34; for sharing with us and allowing us to be a part of their lives."
1,It was okay I guess.
1,This show rocks! Even my husband loves it
1,"Classic film.  Kirk Douglas begins his stardom here.  For its time, it is excellent."
1,Mike Binder is a genius around the nuances of families.  If you liked &#34;The Upside of Anger&#34; then you will like this movie too.  Binder doesn't get the accolades he deserves.
1,Nothing but spectacular.
1,Great science fiction
1,I'm late getting on the Downtown Abbey bandwagon but I'm there now and I enjoyed the series.
0,This movie a croc
1,Liked season 4 a lot better than season 3
1,Good show
1,"Great story with memories of the days when things were different, but also much the same!"
1,Great characters good story and a lot of fun to watch
1,Great show! I was out on disability for six weeks recovering from surgery and discovered this show on my tablet. Kept me entertained for hours a day. I'm now on season two and it is just as good. The covers a lot of moral issues that you still think about long after the show is over.
1,A tiny bit slow starting but now I'm hooked!
1,"Great show, love it"
1,"An amazing episode all around! Definitely worth watching over & over. Great special effects, wonderful story line that answers a lot of questions in the over all DW storyline ."
1,"A beautiful animation and a sweet story. I put it on for my boys 6 and 8 to watch and was quickly drawn in myself. Boy boys enjoyed it, but my 6 year old especially loved it. A great family movie for boys or girls."
0,"not my thing i guess, only watched first episode."
1,Excellent show!!
1,A great series.  Every bit as good as its predecessor.  Keep it coming.
0,Boring
1,Grown up !
1,"We loved Boardwalk Empire, but was very upset that season 5 was held back from Amazon Prime's members.  We had no warning, other wise we may not have become involved with this HBO mini series. This is not for the general public as the violence, language, sexual content & nudety is probably rated R or better."
1,Its a fun show ... reminds me of Jennifer Garner's Alias -- but not quite so heavy!
1,Great
1,The whole series grabbed me. Sorry to see it end. Obviously it had to at some point.
1,"I absolutely love this series. I started with season one and I am impatiently waiting for season 4. It is amazing to watch Tatiana play so many different parts with totally different personalities. I don't give 5 stars but had to on this series, so much going on and so many intersecting lines... I love it. Definitely recommend this series however NOT for watching with little ones around also for me the sex scenes are not my thing. With that said.... I still have to give it 5 stars"
1,AWESOME!!!
1,"Honest, real-life like"
1,"Same as all the other seasons.  Our daughter has loved it since about 8 months old, she's a bit over 1.5yo now.  She loves to talk to us about what's going on and of course can say many of the character names.  Combined with us talking to her constantly about what's going on (we don't just park her in front of the TV for extended periods) and the educational nature of the show... our daughter is doing very well developmentally.  Our pediatrician is impressed so I'd definitely recommend sitting down with your kid(s) and watching the show and engaging with them.  I remember the shows from my childhood as well so it has a bit of nostalgia to it.  It does wear thin on adults (my wife and I included) but that's the price of having a child right?  Make the time investment when they are young and you will have a much easier time when they are older."
1,Had the potential to be a good show but sadly it was a disappointment.  Worth watching if you are bored.
1,Great show
1,"My granddaughter(71/2) loved it , she noticed the clay animation and so very much enjoyed the collection...."
1,I enjoyed the movie even though it was occasionally hard to follow.
1,I like the show
1,"Shaun the Sheet is funny I am a 62 year old grandma who watches with my eight year old grandson.  We die laughing at the episodes. Nice, clean and hilarious.."
1,My toddler loves this show!
1,Deserves a sequel
1,Totally hooked on this show!!!!!!!!!!
1,Very cute. But not for children! Could be pretty scary!
1,Great flick. Family comes first.
1,Great movie.  Have watched it several times.
1,Pretty good
1,Always love 24
1,"Great, no dull moments!"
1,Love this show!
1,I really enjoy this series.  The story of a royal family in the 1800's is quite interesting.  I love how it showcases not only the royal family but also the staff that runs the estate as well.  The accents are a bit hard to pick up in the beginning and I had to keep reviewing scenes to get what some were saying.
1,"Mr. Robot is a very deep and compelling insight into how we process and react to information in a world filled with technology, as based on our previously learned constructs of life.<br />Transversely, it explores the impact of what we previously knew with a view from 'outside the box'. What DOES happen when the journey of the shaping of our minds is tested by situations outside of what we previously believed, or perhaps what situations have led us to our views of society and technology in the first place. Who is in control of either?"
1,My son and I really enjoyed this one. Funny :-)
1,"If you're just looking to bide your time and nothing better to do, watch this movie. If you're looking for a movie that is plausible and entertaining, choose another!"
1,So so
1,"Funny, easy to watch and I love the natural and relaxed interaction of their relationship.  Refreshing!!!"
1,Very well written.  Excellent production values.  Gripping and entertaining television with an intelligent twist.
1,We loved it!  It was a terrific movie.
1,"Quirky, funny. Not hardcore sci-fi. Feels like a Simon Pegg movie."
1,This documentary gave me a different perspective on a band I have loved for 20 years.  It was very informative and detailed.  I strongly recommend it to any Decandants fan.
1,Really enjoyed
0,No thank you. Just not feeling it
1,"It was cute, but the plot seemed a bit flaky. There didn't seem to be enough substance even though the actors gave great performances."
1,scary
1,"well written, great acting, for a premise that was based in reality."
1,True Aaron Sorkin awesomeness.
1,"Far fetched as hell, but a decent show nonetheless"
1,"A great romantic movie (definitely a chick flick) with an interesting twist at the end.  It's light, not overly violent.  I would recommend mostly to women or to a couple."
1,A really addicting show. Great acting and good writing.
1,My 2 year just loves this show and has already learned do much about many animals. He'll say things that I know he would have only learned from this show. It's so cute.
1,Fascinating  and thought-provoking.  Well worth renting!!!
1,The series improved.
0,No rating on it not suitable for kids .
1,My granddaughter LOVES watching this program on my I-Pad!
1,Love the series. Wish season 3 was on prime.
1,"Caught me by surprise, very well done!"
1,Very well done.  I enjoyed it a thoroughly and learned a lot at the same time.
1,Seriously it's Rudy-have you been living under a rock? Watch it-it's a classic. Best underdog movie of the century!
1,"This show defies all expectations, Tatiana Maslany is just incredible at her craft/"
1,"Over all it was an enjoyable movie, just understand in advance it really isn't all that good."
0,a lot of talking and very little showing
1,"Two of my favorite actors of all time. Funny, funny show. The Brits just know how to do comedy."
1,Went so far away drom the book and not in a good way.
1,"I loved the frist 7 Seasons, but on the 8th season it starts to get all political. It's still interesting."
1,"A well done feel good movie.  Quite funny at points, not sure if intentional or not. I thoroughly enjoyed the twist from the standard Hercules plot line."
0,Just average movie
1,"The first episode of season one got me hooked, By episode 6 a bit of intensity has disappeared for me as emphasis shifts to people relationships."
1,My 3 (almost 4) year old loves to watch this show. She asks to watch it on a daily basis! I only wish more than one season was available. Arty's character is so clever and creative with the activities. An added bonus is being able watch actual children create and explain the crafts so we can make them together. Definitely a keeper.
1,"I'm on my second time of viewing this series (since I initially bought the complete set back in 2009/10).  I appreciate that it's free to stream with my PRIME membership, and even better since it offers captions/subtitles which my dvd's do not.<br /><br />Just today I learned something I didn't know before.  I was reading a topic on the &#34;Dr. Quinn&#34; IMDB page, and a fan mentioned that, the order in which the episodes were filmed, is NOT the order that they were aired.  Because of that, there's a continuity issue (events out of order).<br />If you want to view it in the correct order, check out the episode guide (and scroll to the bottom of page): drquinnmd.com/library/episodes1.html<br /><br />As for this show, I love period pieces, and I like the fact that this is pretty much PG rated.  It's becoming increasingly harder to find a period/historical drama with this level of rating, as so many are opting for whatever is shocking, violent, and immoral/raunchy.<br />While &#34;DQMW&#34; tackles some tough issues of the post civil war era, it helps the viewers see them as a sort of abject lesson.<br />It's worth bearing in mind, that the real people and events sometimes portrayed (such as in season 3), are not always accurately depicted.<br />Of course, this isn't meant to be a historical documentary, and as with many other historically based dramas, artistic license comes into play.<br /><br />If you're looking for something similar to watch, I recommend &#34;Christy&#34; (19 ep's), &#34;When Calls the Heart&#34; (ongoing Hallmark series-- 2 seasons & counting), &#34;Road to Avonlea&#34; (7 seasons), and &#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34; (4 seasons)."
1,Love it
1,Good SF angle
1,Great show
1,Keeps on ...making me wonder how he will survive a powerful nation.  Values vs power.<br />The man actor..wor. is a modern sherlock
1,"Void of action, but very good survival story. Enduring 34 days lost at sea in a small rubber raft is hard to imagine. These three aviators show what true grit, fortitude and heroism is. True story."
1,The best-ever series
1,my degree is in history. Even I learned many interesting and provocative facts. The filming is gorgeous. Narrator is Richard Chamberlain. His voice is ideal for the commentary.
1,Awesome! !
1,"Interesting program.  In some ways, a typical police program but the characters have drawing power.  Good show."
1,Love this cartoon show
0,I've seen bad but I could hear the sucking noise get progressively louder as the movie played.  I couldn't watch the whole thing.
1,"I enjoyed this movie, it was entertaining."
1,Loved the 2 main character
0,It shouldn't cost money. I was tricked to buy it
1,"Interesting, complex characters with passion and heart. Can't wait for the next season!"
1,I really enjoy the twists and turns of this show. The relationships are interesting.
1,Very educational and great for kids
1,Storyline is getting better!
1,"I had heard of this show and thought it would be interesting. I had no idea how it would suck me into the world of Downton, upstairs and down. I love it. LOVE."
1,My 4 year old loves watching it!
1,Good
1,Ron Perlman never disappoints!
1,A good movie. Definitely some surprises along the way.
1,Interesting story. Could have been enhanced w subtitles. That said; very well done. I recommend this film.
1,My only complaint? Only 6 episodes! Loved it!
1,awesome movie
0,"Pretty weak show. I really wanted to like it as  the books are great. Could not make it through the pilot, so maybe it gets better but the show cod not hold my attention."
1,Great movie for the grandchildren
1,Pretty much my headline describes my review. Didn't capture me enough to buy the season.
1,I love this show!
1,well done. a hard bit of film involving the aborigine people and what they face.
1,it was okay of the show
1,very good movie
1,"Great show, very funny and entertaining. Looking forward to Season 2!"
1,Pretty good movie. I enjoyed it.
1,We loved this show and were so sad when it came to an end....... someone needs to do more seasons..
1,Very entertaining!
1,Enjoyed it very much...
1,Great movie
1,Only4
1,"Well written, well acted show.  Love it!"
1,Good
1,"The story is good,  portraying a relationship between the teacher and the student (college age) that has to be hidden and how it evolves."
0,"The story line remains loyal to the actual historical facts, in most parts.  The acting was mediocre.  The cinematography was marginal. but ... the director and producer most definitely show strong promise of future movie efforts.  Mr. Felder was, indeed, an American Patriot of the first order - as were ALL the members of his family."
1,"There is mislabeling in the movie credits, which says starring Rocki DuCharme, Sara Lynne Wright.<br /><br />Actually and effectively, it is starring Keira Knightly and ChloÃ« Grace Moretz. The whole movie revolves around the characters played by these two actresses. It is fun watching Keira try maintain her north American accent, without falling back into Londonish."
1,Love blue bloods
1,good
1,Great actors and a funny and yet  poignant story.
1,"Some of the changes in the beginning were a little tough, but I do like where the story is going now, and the new guy, Richter is hot!!"
1,A terrific series
1,this was always one of my favorites. I had it on DVD but am going &#34;cloud based&#34;.
1,Gripping story about good guy holding fast.
1,"Great dialog, great chemistry with these two, love the humor. Really fun to watch."
1,I think this is a very funny CLASIC film that will be around forever.
0,It seemed funnier the first time.  I wanted a friend to see it but just didn't pop for us.
1,"Great movie, both kids and adults enjoyed!"
1,Fun and Funny
1,Just a great story.
1,Has potential to be an offbeat dramedy. Fun watch
1,Can't think of a better movie to watch when you need your Kiss fix.
1,"The witty banter and insightful characterization makes this classic fun to watch. The actors bring to life their parts, and surpass the obvious stereotypes they were derived from."
1,Nothing beats this generation style.
1,Great interactions with great actors!
1,"I give a 5 star rating because this show was way ahead of it's time... it came out in the mid '60s. The writing, the acting, the concepts were always fresh and clever. It's refreshing that many of the concepts the show dealt with are still relevant, even in 2015, inequality, racism, corruption, xenophobia, etc. (on the show, it's supposed to be the 23rd century). It's also interesting that even though in the series man had mastered space travel and dealt with strange new worlds and sought out new life, etc. In 2015 we have powerful computers and cell phones (just like the communicator in Star Trek) but still have not mastered space travel! What a bummer!"
1,"A great story. Justice was justice.  If you enjoy suspense and mystery and awesome acting this is a treasure. No spoilers here, even if there were something in the movie to spoil. Just watch it, feel it and wonder if you yourself have the capacity to change for the better. If you think you do, don't wait a second, start right now. From my own personal experience I tell you do it now. If you're alone, no friends, no family and no one who cares, specifically yourself. Deep inside of you there is a soul or call it heart, the terminology doesn't matter, but that part wants to live. Dig into that part, do whatever it takes to make people, strangers, those in the medical field or anyone notice you're hurt and broken and that you don't really care. If you keep trying to get someone to notice, a good someone. Someone who enjoys giving instead of taking will see you. It's a long journey from  hell to heaven, it's a hard one, it's exhausting and painful. But the road is there, why stay in Hell any longer than you have to. Jump on that path and go."
1,Good flick. Like characters
1,"I found it interesting, but wordy in places.  Good documentry though."
1,Great Movie!
1,The boys love it
1,Cute movie. Keeps your attention but disappointing overall.
1,"Not bad, but not the best comedy I've seen by far."
1,"Excellent presentation, Marion Cotillard's performance as Edith Piaf is unparalleled I was not sure I wanted to deal with subtitles but by the end of the movie the subtitles were just an insignificant part of the experience.  Easily the best movie and performance I have seen in many years."
1,Would have rated higher but for the obvious introduction of feminist agenda dialogue. I assure you Leonidas was not motivated by his wife to take heroic measures. Such is a projection of contemporary feminism onto the past.
1,3 is fair
1,Smart and well written.  Acting is good and snappy.
1,It's finally picked up and now is worth watching.
1,"I don't really understand wanting to live like this, but it was really interesting. I liked the emphasis of the use of solar power."
1,great
1,"This is a drama/love story with a charming and heart-warming ending.  Family friendly.  May or may not be based on a true story; there are some conflicting reports out there on that fact.  However, the movie is well acted and has an A-list cast.  Worth watching.  The moving is older (released around 1993 or so) but doesn't &#34;feel&#34; dated when you're watching it."
1,A total classic. So fun to watch it again and reminisce.  4 stars because it really got me looking forward to watching the rest of the seasons and they are not available. Please bring the rest back too.
1,My daughters and I are glad we found this adorable movie.
1,"A rather far fetched story line, but a cute movie.  Lovely Scottish scenery.  CLOSDED CAPTIONING NEEDED to assist in understanding dialog."
1,Fun learning
1,Very enjoyable!
1,our little 3 year old granddaughter loves it.
1,"This movie shows the risks & contributions early colonists gave for our freedom. It is based on historical fact. This man came to the U.S. as a freedom fighter from Switzerland to fight Indians in the NewWorld & liked America so well, he stayed to fight for freedom. So good I purchased it!"
1,"fun family movie. parents and kids (8,9,6) really enjoyed it and the kids were laughing out loud. our sensitive six year old did cry a couple of times when she thought something bad was going to happen to the dog, but otherwise, it was really enjoyable for everyone."
1,My kids love this show and it's not super annoying like most kid shows.
1,We felt it was ok.  loved the sex.  Needs more plot...  otherwise it was ok
1,Nothing short of awesome!
1,Pretty pretty pretty good
1,My grandson loves it- enough said.
1,A funny one-time movie. Probably would not watch the second time though.
1,Excellent
1,would have had 5 but too much language and deserves it's R rating<br />use to enjoy it more
0,It didn't grab my attention at all.
1,It will make you laugh.
1,"I was luke-warm on this show for much of season one, but I've come to really like it. It has an edginess that other similar shows do not. I'm still a little troubled by the way plot threads suddenly appear and then just as suddenly go away, but all-in-all a very watchable show."
1,Every trailer park stereotype and more.
1,It is OK
1,Best series in the Stargate stories.
1,Great show
1,My wife's favorite show. I fancy it as well.
1,Really Good
1,"This is one of the most intriguing mysteries I've seen.  The character Saga from Sweden is unique to police drama; Martin, from Denmark, is a perfect choice of co-worker.  The differences between policing in Sweden and Norway is well drawn; the victim, cut into two parts and placed on the border line,  is part Swedish and part Danish. How to solve a case that crosses borders and involves both society's problems?  The Bridge, a collaborative production effort, is well worth watching."
1,Enjoyed Kathy Bates performance in this series. Stevie Nicks has nice cameos in a few of the episodes.
1,"Was an excellently produced film but liked the soundtrack in the first one better. The second in this series felt as if something more was left out, but will wait with baited breath for the final film, as I read the entire series in about two weeks & was mezmerized by each one! Perhaps I should have waited to see the films first, but the Divergent left me impatient for more, and Insurgent, while graphically brilliant, didn't do the same for me. The relationship between Tris and Four wasn't as powerful as it appeared in Divergent, or all 3 books, but it still had outstanding moments that gave its audience an urge to stand up & cheer out loud at the screen! (Sorry - no spoilers from me!)<br />The real test will be Allegient's release next year, and the way the writers/director portray its incredible ending to Veronica Roth's genius work! All in all, I still loved the movie (and Shailene Woodley doesn't disappoint either!) so would highly recommend watching it several times to catch all the subtle events going on in the film. Then get yourself to a bookstore and buy this gripping and easy-reading trilogy for an in depth explanation of SO much more that just had to be left on the cutting-room floors! It's WELL worth the read, I can promise you that! Couldn't wait for the next chapter to start!"
0,I Love Audrey ... but not this Film  Cooper is better as Cowboy  or Detective  .... Sorry but not for me.
1,"Given the shockingly depraved subject matter I was hesitant to view this film at first, but it proved to be a superb study of the emotional investment of a Soviet-era researcher to discover the identity of a serial killer.  With sublime, restrained performances by Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, and a chillingly effective Jeffrey DeMunn, CITIZEN X is an amazingly well crafted and emotional look into how one man's dogged determination to find a killer gains him the grudging respect of his superiors.  Note: some scenes of graphic violence against children and women.<br /><br />Very highly recommended."
1,Classic always enjoyed this movie growing up.  Good to see a young Liam Neeson.
1,Entertaining and fun. My five and two year old will sit together and watch it.
0,"He is so offensive,  and NOT funny"
1,Great movie for the family
1,Terrific
1,Loved it!
0,waste of film
1,A
1,Great movie!
0,Could't handle more than 5 minutes of story.
1,Don't plan on multitasking while watching. It worth viewing every minute! Excellent cast!
1,"Mia Hall played by Chloe Grace Moretz in &#34;If I Stay&#34;.  Mia is a teenager who's very good with the cello and has the potential to get admitted to Julliard.  She has an slightly older boyfriend, not in high school, who is in a band that is on the verge of breaking out into the big time. Experiencing the comfort of home and fear of an uncharted future when BLAM!  (SPOILER ALERT)  On a snow day there's a car accident that leaves her unconscious/severely  injured and Mom & Dad dead.  Her little brother seems to have gotten the least of it, but nope, he dies too.  While all this is going on she is having an out of body experiences and basically has to decide if she's going to go towards the light like her family.  Who doesn't seem to have been offered that choice.  But then again, we don't see any other out of body people even at the hospital so maybe the audience is only privy to Mia's plight.  Or the other choice that she is reminded of by the living is to fight for life and stay.  That's all I'm going to say about the plot.<br /><br />I generally like this type of movie.  If you don't, even at the free Amazon Prime price you probably won't like It.  You may wanna see &#34;If Only&#34;.  It's even better than this movie is, but it's still the same type.  As you can see by the 4-star rating I did like this movie.  The acting is fine and the story flows well.  So no real negative issues on my part.  If you're on the fence you might as well watch it."
0,I only made it through 15 minutes....it was worse than horrendous.
1,very relaxing I love it :)
1,"Not as good as the first one, but hey, who doesn't like seeing all these fine actors in one spot again...?  But the addition of Richard Gere to this cast line up... all I can say is &#34;meh&#34; for his performance, but he at least created a new story line to have these actors follow.  His character just not as believable, or sincere, but the movie concept is still good.  I think this would make a good series instead.  Keep rotating the basic core characters, but bring in and out guest appearances who have different adventures while at the hotel.  Make it about AGING GRACEFULLY!"
1,Different kind of show
1,Took place in one room but held my attention.
1,It's different then the Hercules that I knew in the movies grown up .. I found in really enjoyable  I was pleasantly surprised
1,"Although great actors, I was expecting a bit more of this movie."
1,"Love the show, is brilliant,"
1,IS INTERESTING AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT EPISODE. IT'S KIND OF ADDICTIVE
1,This is by far my favorite television program: ever!!! Engaging for both young and old.
1,I love this show
1,Best show out there!
1,It was a little slow but I enjoyed watching it.
1,Great laughs
1,"Good movie with lots of action, suspense."
1,Watch Cheers over and over.  One of all time greats.
1,Excellent show.  Great plot with unexpectant twists and turns.  A number of suberb actors and actresses.  I love science fiction and this is one captivating show.
1,Never ending drama from one show to another
0,its OK
1,"Best of the series, after the first one of course"
1,scary
1,Fun movie
1,These two together are great.
1,This is my new favorite show!
1,Toro does a great job!
1,kinda like 24 but way too much porn
1,"Super funny, and a little heartwarming. Would recommend"
1,Great show!
1,I LOVED THIS SERIES.........SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT IT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED !!!!!!!  VERY GOOD SERIES !!!!
1,It's very good
1,It is great.  These cartoons get better with age.
1,Interesting take on Greek mythology
0,"I did not like the fact  that the producers condoned Jonathan's constant abusive behavior towards his wife Victoria,<br />and harassment of his fellow contestants just so they can have high ratings on the show.  I also felt bad that the<br />women had no options but to board the mandated mode of transportation thereby exposing them to humiliating<br />situations where they were fondled and groped."
1,Watched for my 4th or 5th time.  One of the very best shows ever done for TV.
0,Boring and predictable
0,Predictable and Lame. Maybe a 13 year old will enjoy it?
1,"Nice continuation to the first offering, Divergent.  Looking forward to the next offering in the trilogy."
1,Loved it laughed and cried
1,My son loves this show!
1,One of the best films written and acted.  Riveting.
0,Xxxxxxcccc
0,It was not at all what I expected. They should have showed a black and white older picture instead of the one they showed on the cover so I would have known instantly that it was older material. I did see on the info later that it was from the 60's but the cover obviously was misleading. Not much to it and not what I was hoping for.
1,"I am the person who laments the fact that there is very little worth watching. Never was, really. So I was delighted when I found this series. Original - doesn't go formula on you. Give it time and you will be rewarded. PLEASE say there is a Season 2!"
1,Great show!  Had missed the first season on TV.
1,"Loving Annabelle is a pleasant movie with attractive actors, good direction and beautiful scenery but it has the feel of a 20th Century soap opera, though a soap opera with a tragic ending."
1,"good at first, later drags"
1,Great!!!
1,great
0,"Not as family friendly as seasons 1-8.  Vala,a guest star, is sexually aggressive in a way that l find embarrassing to watch in front of the kids.  I keep wondering if the new threat to earth &#34;the Ori&#34; are bashing organized religion in the way they are portrayed.  Instead of false gods, this manipulative sect, mirrors too closely the religious roots of my own faith, so I find it offensive.  The original team of SG1 are no longer together, so some of my favorite characters are missing."
1,Best show ever.
1,My children and I LOVE this movie
1,So good.
1,"Great characters, richly drawn and cool aesthetic"
1,Love this show!
1,Reminds me of The Walking Dead but with aliens instead of zombies. A great post-apocalyptic thriller. Good character development. You definitely are on the edge of your seat. I'm sad it's over but it was a fun series.
1,Best show ever<br />Season 4 is needed
1,it was good.
1,"Very funny, great chemistry and refreshing look at how people really behave. I was so disappointed to finish the season so quickly. I hope it returns and I can binge watch again!"
1,Love this TV show. It is one you just can't stop watching till you have reached the last one and are forced to stop till they make more.
1,"Very suspenseful, keeps your mind going"
1,Great
1,Excellent
1,This move is Grown-ups for the cartoon lover in you.  The Cast from Grown-ups are all here. so if you enjoyed that movie and want to watch somthing funny with the kids.  This is my pick.
1,"compelling and provocative story about personal journey through grief and despair, numbness to life's joys, and a return to living in color with feeling and an ability to love deeply again. though i haven't read the book, the movie feels like it may be struggling at times to live up to the author's radical honesty and depth, but witherspoon's performance shines and carries the day."
1,Hooked.
1,I loved it
0,Ya know I've tried to watch this movie all the way through twice and just can't stay interested. It's got your typical shock moments but really not so good.
1,One of the best shows on tv
1,Great flic
1,Decent movie<br />Typical gladiator style with lots of one liners
1,Absolutely loved it!!  Don't make us wait too long for more episodes!
1,"Such a simple show, very well done."
1,"Wonderful season that shouldn't be missed. Actually, highly anticipated. There are some twist and turns in this season, which had a good finale.<br />I can't wait for the next season, as I heard Season 6 could be the last one."
0,Not very good. Adults acting like teens is not interesting.
1,Bill Murray surprises again.
1,Great acting and story.
1,Amazing. Such a great story & the music is phenomenal.
1,Highly enjoyed
0,Boring . Very disappointed. An insult to the book
1,Good but not as consistently funny as I remembered it.
1,"Sons of Anarchy is intense, gripping.  I've had too many nights of too little sleep because I couldn't turn it off."
1,My daughter loves it just as much as I did as a kid! Plus it's not crazy animation with no lessons :)
1,A very entertaining series...a favorite
1,After one episode I am interested to see how this progresses. I think it will be a good show as we grow interest in the new plot and characters.
0,Schlecht gemacht
1,I love these and never tire of re-watching them.
1,"This is one of those movies that was a box office miss but I ain't sure why? It's fun, action packed and, if you're a Marine, kinda motivating. Small unit working together to survive and eventually take out the aliens. It's seemed realistic in the world of sci-fi. My son enjoyed it greatly and I think if you step back and forget the big name bulls*** sci-fi that's out there you will see an enjoyable and action pack flick that you can just enjoy for what it is; a hidden gem in the realm of contemporary sci-fi that is lying in the open."
1,Better than advertised
1,"I'm a little over half-way through the first season and so far so good! It's pretty exciting and the characters are interesting to watch. I'm hoping for a little more character development as the show progresses. Also, I've always been a huge fan of Sophia Bush and she doesn't disappoint!"
1,Great tv series
1,It was ok.
1,Really good but moves WAY too slow.
1,"My &#34;new&#34; favorite series ever! Love that they use real-world events and then deconstruct the behind-the-scenes process of reporting the news. Lots of insight into the mechanics, psychology and personalities that go into the decisions as to what & how the event is broadcast. The personal interactions and back-stories are meaningful because of the great character development--we care about these people!"
1,This was a great movie that told the truth about our young adults and the things they have to endure! This movies brought tears to my eyes!!
1,was a very good movie.
0,"Slow, predictable, boring."
1,Best movie I have seen in a long time. Will share with family
1,"Some decent action.<br />I'm an Aaron Eckhart fan - but he didn't seem to fit the role.<br />Overall, Not bad - But the script was fairly contrived and predictable."
1,Despite the dominant Euro actors rolling out hard R's--the story line is solid with Tom Hardy becoming the new multi-lingual actor with believable accents in his early career joining Seymor-Hoffman as the go to guy for the tough multifaceted acting spots.
1,Gripping spy narratives continue!
0,Boring
1,Great show!
1,"Good drama, well written screen adaptation!"
1,Wonderful series. I have enjoyed every episode...A must watch.....
1,"A good show, with very good reenactors.  The show has a new code, anywhere from ancient times to the present.  My only problem with th show is that it seems to move along very slowly.  Maybe it's just me, but when I watch shows like Forensic Files and Mysteries at the Museum, the time seems to zoom by compared to this one."
1,It was a good movie but it was a little too slow at times.
1,"Funny and realistic.  Some of the episodes were not as funny, but in general terms, I enjoyed this adult comedy series."
1,Binged through five seasons...  Don't know how I missed this series...definitely hooked now.
1,John Hughes at his best
1,Loved this show.
1,Loved it. Very compelling.  Better not miss an episode.
1,Duke is a real star!
1,Great Series!
1,Enjoyable
1,I liked the way it showed the troubles in her life and the power of forgiveness.
1,"My 2yo loves it, so I love it."
1,"Again, unbelievably good writing and passionate performances...it is so much fun to escape into their crazy world.  I am only sad because I know the end (of Deadwood) is approaching..."
1,"One of my favorite anime series of all time. Great character development, amazing character stories, and the story itself is rich, well paced, and well developed. I truly hope we geat a season 2, as the first season/2 cours are just not enough.<br /><br />This is not your typical shoujo, so be sure to go past episode 1."
1,Love this movie
1,"Great movie, love it. Once of my favorites and the qualiy is great."
1,Good
0,Uninteresting.
1,"Being a fan of Mirren and Gooding I would of course like this movie. It is not the best work for either of them, but it is still a very enjoyable film. It isn't strictly a drama or an action flick, sort of a cross between the two, with drama being slightly ahead. I am not good at synopsis, especially spoiler free synopsis, so I am not going to even try, plus there are reviews here that give an excellent synopsis of the movie. I am not sure of Mirren's age in this, I would guess near 60, possibly even older and yet she still projects  an unbelievable amount  of sex appeal. Even more so than the much younger and one would suppose much sexier Vanessa Ferlito.  Gooding does an excellent job as the conflicted, emotionally stunted man who loves and depends on Mirren. The rest of the cast give excellent performances, and Joseph Gordon-Levett and Mo'nique are not only a hoot of a couple they also make you believe that they are passionately involved. I would recommend it to fans of the actors and to fans of crime and revenge movies."
1,"In a time where Vampires, werewolves, and even zombies are being put through the &#34;Twilight&#34; treatment, stripping them of all their terror and replacing it with lukewarm sex appeal, What We Do In The Shadows takes the desiccated husk of all these poor horror icons and injects them with some humorous new life. Instead of making the monsters terrifying or sexy to braindead underage girls, they give them a sense of humanity and a desire to simply live life like us normal, pre-dead average joes.<br /><br />With talents like Jemaine Clement of Flight of The Conchords in the lead roles, this film is filled with hilarious scenes of blood-sucking, shapeshifting, and in some cases monstrous vampires dealing the the troubles of modern day life. Ever wonder if vampires hate getting blood on the carpet during every meal? Well it's addressed here in hilarious fashion. How does someone who has recently been turned into a vampire essentially &#34;come out&#34; to his best friend while addressing the elephant in the room, that many of his new friends want to eat said best friend? You have the best friend introduce the new vampire friends to the wonders of modern technology! Ever wonder what happens when two vampires have an argument? They turn into bats and fight one another.<br /><br />Simply said, What We Do In The Shadows is a hilarious film brimming with tons of dark humor lightened by the fact that these creatures of the night just want to have a good time and get the rent paid on time."
1,Keep episodes coming!!!
1,"This movie is a family favorite.  From the funny one-liners (&#34;You don't think I'd steal something that didn't belong to me, do you?&#34;), to the romance, to the mustached guard who can make us laugh without saying a word, it's just an all-around entertaining show."
1,Colin Firth is my favorite Mr. Darcy. You can't do any better than that!
1,"Although I miss Nick Groff, this is still Ghost Adventures and they still deliver fascinating evidence with a battery of technology and equipment. Zac is still his excitable and passionate self. Aaron is much more confident than in the early series. The team is now composed of Zac and Aaron with Billy and Jay their tech guys. Looking forward to more episode and evidence that is pretty hard to debunk."
1,Awesome! So glad to see it again. I watched this with my Father growing up so it brings back good memories.
1,Excellent show. I love it!
1,"Why haven't I watched this before? Awesome, awesome, awesome. Robert Devaul, your my hero!"
1,"These are French Lessons, not a movie!"
1,Wonderful movie always heard great things but had never gotten around to watching it. It's everything you've come to expect from Guillermo del Toro.
1,"Nice suspense and action movie.  Much more than what is in the description.  If you are looking for psychiatric sessions, look somewhere else."
1,thenhetnhtetht
1,It's an excellent series.  Shows much of the day to day footwork of the police and the investigation steps to solve and close cases.  Not so much crazy gross killings.
1,What twists and turns.  What next!!
1,She loves learning her shapes
1,Funny- glad the made a second one
1,Can't wait for the next season.
1,"Excellent TV show, lots of fun!"
1,"I streamed this film in late August 2015. It looked like widescreen VHS. The HD indicator was visible, but it looked like crap. This was not a bandwidth issue; the copy on Amzon's servers is low quality and absolutely not worth 6.99."
1,"Not as addicting as season one, but it feeds the hunger."
1,"Unrealistic, but a nice no-thoughts-required movie to watch when you're in the mood for something like that"
1,I just love this show so much.  I have watched all the seasons over and over again. Not one negative thing to say.
1,"The question of comedians being crazy/troubled/depressed et al as a REQUIREMENT to be funny is presented and given a great presentation through a very wide assemblage of talents many of whom acquit themselves as being what is not often appreciated as a requisite for comedy- these folks are really, really smart<br />I had this as 4 star & then realized I must mean 5!"
1,"I watched the ENTIRE series from start to finish stopping only for necessities and sleep, if that does not tell you it was GREAT nothing will."
1,Witty dark comedy
1,"Five Days wasn't bad, but it seemed like they could have told the whole story in 2-3 episodes. Felt like there was a ton of time used that was pointless."
1,Didn't want it to end!
0,"In spite of the excellent acting, this movie is a complete waste of time.  The plot is poorly developed and I found it impossible to recognize any of the scenes as plausible.  If you like gratuitous violence and nudity violence this film might offer something.  It has been said before, but I'll never get the hour and 43 minutes back.  Save your time and money."
1,Awesome series...
1,Funny show
1,Addictive and exciting!!
1,The best show ive seen in years
1,Love it
1,"I have only watched the first episode so far, but they folks involved in this have done an excellent job of translating the characters to film."
1,"I avoided watching this movie for countless years even though it was thrown in my face by every online movie rental organization. Left with nothing really to watch one weekday spent in a hotel room, with hesitation and reluctance, I began watching this movie. There are many quality actors in it and I have to say that unfortunately, Ms. Paltrow is not one of them. (And I do appreciate her talents immensely.) If you're looking for a somewhat, not too girly, romantic movie with plenty of opportunities to laugh, this is it. Bottom line is that I am pleased with my time spent watching this movie."
0,"Informative, but not that engaging."
0,Love Kevin Kline as an actor.<br />This movie is depressing and left me feeling the same way.<br />Sure glad my life is not like this movie.<br />Maybe I'll watch Mary Poppins!
1,continues to deliver great entertainment
1,"This a great series, I really liked it alot."
1,"This is a great series. Not many westerns that are new left. Takes me back to the 60's and Gunsmoke. Sorry this is the last season, I'll miss my fix on Saturday nights."
0,The trailer was better than the movie.
1,My four year old loves this movie!
1,Smart and crisp comedy!
0,Couldn't get past the first 30 minutes - it was watching a group of girls and boys walking and talking aimlessly. Then one finally gets killed...assume others will too. Special effects are not very special - clearly someone throwing red colored water from off camera during the one slaughter scene I saw. Not even cheesy enough to laugh at. Just plain terrible.
1,It was sad to hear about Paul Walker. It was really good I think they did the ending of the movie in a good way.
1,Enjoyed Season 1.  Can't wait for Season 2 to start.
1,Great show
1,Same review as for Season !  LOVE IT
1,"Such a touching story, Ryan Reynolds does a great job. There should be more teachers like him."
1,"One of the best TV shows. Acting is superb, story's are copied from our every day lives. you feel like this happened yesterday or today. Great stuff"
1,Like It
1,A pleasant movie to watch with all the family.
1,I wonder why Americans have accepted the ludicrous &#34;official&#34; explanations for the tragic mess that was 9/11.
1,Excellent
1,My Daughtry lives this show. Needs more seasons
1,This is an excellent series.  I am sad I have watched all the Seasons and there are no more.
1,loved it
1,Great special effects and lots of good acting.<br />Love SF and Space Operas but JA left me a bit flat - the plot had more holes in it than Swiss Cheese. I really wanted to like RA and it wasnâ€™t bad but I was disappointed. Not sure what more the wonderful actors and the Wachowskis could do with the nonsense plot. Still it was a good shoot â€˜em up and had many heroes and villains. At best we can hope that there is no sequel.
1,Very enjoyable.
1,Very interesting and in depth look at the influence of the British auto industry from late 1800's to present. Good episode focusing on Brooklands.
1,I love Giovanni Ribisi! I'm interested to see where this series goes.
0,JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT.
1,Great movie!
1,A bit dull
1,"great stuff,,,timeless"
0,I was terribly disappointed. This was not an upbeat movie.
1,Too slow in the beginning.  Turned it off as it didn't interest me in the first 10 minutes.
1,Great movie best of the series
1,"It was really good for the first half, but the last half was too &#34;chop em up&#34; for me."
1,Enjoyed seeing the progression of Agent Annie Walker. Too bad it was cancelled.
1,"intelligent, caring, and great directing and acting.  What's not to like.  Doesn't overdo violence even though it is a spy drama.  At least not too much."
0,Disappointing.
1,Good movie for little kids
0,Joanna Newsome makes me want to fill my ears with hot glue.
0,Totally went over the top trying to do a negative story about investors. Probably the worst movie ever made! This is what happens when you promote an agenda.
1,"Followed the book nicely, Might be a little hard to follow in some places if you have not read the book."
1,Good show
1,The acting was phenomenal.  Interesting story - not sure I really understood what the main character (the reporter) was experiencing or feeling. Myabe I need to watch it again - it seemed a little vague to me - but I enjoyed watching it.
1,Love this show! It has its cheesy moments but it definitely keeps me entertained and I just love Stephen King.
1,This is one of the best shows I've ever had the privilege to watch.  My only complaint is that watching these back to back has been burning up my work day :).
1,"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,Great series!
1,Escape with the &#34;bug&#34; busters! Just as much fun as MIB1. Medusa-like &#34;villain-esse&#34; might be too much for youngsters under 10 tho. So great to know these cool dudes are watching out for us!! Buttered popcorn and roaches for all!
1,EXCELLENT
1,Great family movie
1,Thrilling
1,So laugh out loud funny .<br />Intelligent humor.  Very like able<br />Eccentric characters!
1,Excellent televison
1,Perfect movie to watch and discuss with the elderly aunt who will be coming for Thanksgiving and who always seems to agree with you.
1,"Very intense, really brought out a reaction with me."
1,Excellent story line and very well acted. Wish there were more episodes.
1,"Excellent comedy marred by Amazon's continued choking of the bandwidth. So, on my 40&#34; TV I get a 25&#34; picture sometimes.<br />Other times I get a 15&#34; picture.<br />I have used a tape measure.<br />Never this problem streaming Netflix or Acorn or Hulu etc."
1,Was a good short movie
1,Great.
1,"My kids love this show. They could watch it over and over. Ages 4,7,9."
1,Excellent film! Very good story. Actors were awesome!! See it today!!
1,"Willem Dafoe is a fine actor, and the children were delightful.  I was disappointed at the end but will not say why. Don't want to spoil it for the other viewers.  There are some excellent twists and turns to the story, as well as good acting by the supporting actors.  I highly recommend this story."
1,Never a dull moment!!!
1,I enjoyed Dwayne Johnson performance. Lots of action..
1,the best show ever
1,just over the top behavior
1,Anything with Travis Pastrana is sure to be entertaining. That guy is super human.
1,Great family picture.
1,Great show. A little vulger though.
1,"Repetitive, predictable, outlandish, yet somehow still funny. I like them because they are short and make great fillers between other shows."
1,"Good Movie, Suspense, action, and plot twist."
1,It was a good movie overall.  Being a Clint Eastwood fan contributes to my prejudice.  It held my interest to the end.
0,"This movie looks like the film that &#34;Tropic Thunder&#34; was based on. This film, I'm sure, tried to be a serious war movie. It looks authentic with costumes, sets, extras, machines and even makeup, but fails hard in dialog and action. Go see Tropic Thunder instead."
1,"Loved it! I am hankering for more! So I started watching Catastrophe, which she co-writes with the male lead. I DID have to turn on captions a few times, though. I speak American English and could not parse the accent all the time."
1,My 4 year old loves watching it
1,"Season 1 and 2 were much more interesting as a commentary about human nature.  Season 3 turned into a typical King twist to aliens and evil whatever to explain the phenomenon. Should have gone with a better villain. Hive aliens taking over the world, blah blah..."
1,Was informative
1,I found it too be hilarious.  I'm looking forward to season 2.
1,"I like this show very, very much. I especially like the way the plot builds tension from episode to episode. It keeps you coming back to catch the next one. Both the story line and the characters get more complex with each one."
1,Shaun rules.
1,Absolutely loved it!!!  I love movies like this and Denzel Washington was AWESOME!!!
1,Fun
1,Excellent movie.
1,Good
1,"Love Michael Connelly books. Thought it well acted and realistic to times on LA. Use of local places I.e, angel flight etc added a lot. Looking forward to next one"
1,"Wonderful story, great effects...Monica Belluci, hubba, hubba!"
1,"It was an interesting plot,  but the spoiler came within the first few minutes of the film, so it was not suspenseful at all.  However, the difficulty in accurately portraying what it means to investigate human trafficking was interesting.  The emotional impact on the families of the victims and the investigators appeared to be authentic."
1,"OK movie, not great but ok to watch"
1,Great action and realism!
1,Interesting and romantic
1,Super funny! The program doesn't get old.
1,One of the best tv series ever!
1,"Best show about AI that I have ever watched. I love the vision the director has for the way the synthetics move, speak, act, etc. They just did such a great job. Every other show with AI in it has now been ruined for me. The writing is fantastic and the characters are likeable."
1,Was OK. Just OK...
1,Loved it then. Love it now.
1,"Just got back from Ireland, hiking with Mountain Sobek.<br />Wish I'd watched Darby O'Gill before I went.<br />Great introduction to a lot of the folklore that we heard about while we were there.<br /><br />Disney's team worked in lots of double entendres though, to the point were Darby O'Gill might be a kink classic.<br />eg Goolge &#34;string of pearls&#34; & &#34;semen&#34; and see what you get.<br />Likewise for &#34;pulling on the rope&#34; & &#34;masturbation&#34;<br />and &#34;butter churning&#34; & &#34;masturbation&#34;.<br /><br />It could be a treasure hunt looking for other double entendres, but those jumped out at me.<br /><br />I'm surprised that this film was directed at little kids in 1959, quite apart from the above there's plenty of drinking, drunkeness, smoking, violence, witchcraft, etc."
0,none
1,Delivers on the action.  It's what a Mad Max film is supposed to be.  Gets back to the Road Warrior basics.
0,Meh- overrated
1,Great show. Crappy ending
1,"Was a very 'dark' show...did not realize that, will watch more of it later."
1,"The cast of characters is great. Everyone does a great job if getting their characters right. They all mesh somehow. Even though each character is very different they mesh together seamlessly. It does not feel as if characters are forced together.  Also the storyline(s), and there is a lot going on all work and I didnâ€™t get confused with what character is doing what which can happen to me with multiple storylines and several strong characters."
1,I am four episodes in. I really like it so far. I can't believe it is a USA Network show.
1,Great series
1,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:<br /><br />Watched the first 4 episodes.<br /><br />Truth be told, I have never been a fan of Edward Burns as an actor.  I thought he butchered the role of Bugsy Siegel.  However, he does have talent in the director/producer/creator departments.<br /><br />Like:<br /><br />Works as a period piece.  Great attention to detail on site selection, dress, etc.  The transition of NYC into the 1960's<br /><br />Dislike:<br /><br />Nothing really new here by way of plot.  Young \\""Turks\\"" making a move against the old.  While I like Neal McDonough as an actor, I didn't see him in the role of both \\""black sheep\\"" and heir apparent to the Irish mob boss played by Brian Dennehy.  His dialogue seemed stilted and forced.  \\""What did I get, a one way ticket to Palookaville!\\""<br /><br />Rotten Tomatoes gave a \\""Fresh Rating\\"" of 81% while Metacritics a rating of 69 (good), though the NY Times gave a score of 40 and called Public Morals \\""a mess\\"".<br /><br />Personally, I think that the release timing was brilliant (the small gap between the end of the summer season and the start of the fall season).  Also, I like that the first 4-episodes were released \\""On Demand\\"".  While a risky strategy (subsequent to watching the first 4-episodes, one now has to wait a month for new content), I am a fan, as I can generally tell within 4-episodes if I am going to make the commitment to continue watching and if the first 1-2 episodes are slow, I might not wait to watch the 3rd.  I am curious to see what the ratings fall-off will be commensurate with the start of the new fall schedule?<br /><br />While YMMV, Public Morals is worth a look, if for no other reason than the attention to detail in the portrayal of NYC in the early 60's."
1,Awesome
1,I didn't expect to enjoy it but I did.
1,"I thought it was a bit boring.  I did watch all of the episodes, so it was at least that interesting.  But not really that great.  And the title is poorly chosen."
1,It was cute!
1,great movie.  Enjoyed laughing
1,Good but needs more participants
1,"I thought this movie was super cute!  It's no Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but was adorable.  My kids loved it.  We watched it 3 times in 2 days."
1,LOVE IT!
0,Dull and poorly written.
1,The casting is perfect for this genre...Bill Nighy is the only one who can pull off this character.  Adorable
1,My daughter loves this show
1,Favorite teen wolf season. It's has the BEST pack!
1,Great movie
1,Enjoyable comedy.
1,My 5 yr old loved it. Finished all episodes in no time.
1,"nice to visit, without being there."
1,Very entertaining. More-so because you get to watch the series less commercials.
1,"Epic Chinese story with epic scenery and amazing acting.  Action, adventure, romance.  Fantastic martial artistry.  Sit back; savor.  Be entertained."
1,Great movie - story remains compelling all these years later.
1,love It
0,"A curious experiment in how to create a movie nearly completely lacking for plot, character development or dialogue."
1,A wonderful show that has given me a new perspective on life.
1,It's SpongeBob! Season ONE! ;-)
1,loved the series
1,great show! wish it didn't end&#62;&#62;
1,My daughter of two and a half loves this show.
1,The Scoobies and Kiss. What's there not to like.
1,"Fun show!  Both my husband and I were hooked.  Neither one of us ever thought we'd rather dive with a bull shark than go on land, but given the options, we'd take the shark!  Characters are believable and intelligent.  If I ever had the opportunity to participate in something like this, I would want these guys to have my back."
1,"This is the only TV series I've watched on Amazon video; it is that compelling.  The characters, writing, directing and production are outstanding.  I am very sad that it looks as if there will be no season 6.  I've come to care about the characters, and will miss them."
1,Very entertaining
1,Great show.
1,"It was worth an evening watch. Not great, but it was okay."
1,Interesting!
1,Our family really enjoyed the race. It has fun challenges and they liked seeing different countries. We loved Bethany Hamilton and her husband. Very inspirational!
1,Writing is hodge podge and less entertaining than previous seasons.
1,A little disappointing.
1,A play on today's world of  the totalitarian society.
1,Has given my 2 kids endless hours of good entertainment and loads of new concepts.
1,Suspenseful and great
1,"Really sweet and funny movie with many great plot twists and surprises. Andy Garcia and the rest of the cast are excellent and even though your belief is a little stretched, it's a pleasure to watch this hidden gem. Highly recommended."
1,Masters thesis material for psychology students.
1,"I knew about Sriracha from the early 90's but this story of how it began was great.  I actually purchased the Sriracha cookbooks and now have a new love for this magical, mystical hot sauce.<br /><br />Great short and sweet doc about Dave Tran The Hotsauce Man. Great watch and great story. You will not be disappointed."
1,Humerus and somewhat witty but rather predictive most of the time..  It could do without the social engineering....
0,didn't finish it
0,Wraped up in to neat of a bow. It was an over simplification of life lived in fantasy and excess.. The character Vince is irritating as usual. . Wait until its on HBO and free to view when you are home sitting out a hurricane with absolutely nothing else to do.. then it would probably exibit some value
1,Such a great show! Great story lines and characters
0,A part of the Wild West you don't want to see.
1,As good as it was when I was a kid!!
1,"Great show, too bad it was cancelled"
1,"Wonderful show, love it!"
0,Watched a couple of episodes. The fight scenes are not realistic and kinda slow.
1,"It's realistic and I am glad that it is a film to support women and their choices. But I thought we were already there as a society but I guess if you compare to Juno, we are not. (in the media) I didn't realize it was such a stigma against abortion.... still. Well shot. well acted. I thought the 2 leads looked like twins almost - kinda odd when they are supposed to be friends and not sisters. Took me a few minutes to realize they were 2 different people.  Glad to hear more female voices."
0,This is simply propaganda.  Pure and simple.  I hope Amazon decides to remove this.
1,Awesome but my favorite is Glades& Bosch
1,"The intro is well done. I loved most of the movie, some parts got a little slow but not too bad. I love that they attempted to do something like this. very funny. love how they involved the different character stereotypes, with susan sarandon and kathy bates. very clever. my 7 year old son does the hamburger scene, it took us awhile to figure out what he was doing with his hair and hands...a hoot."
1,The best
1,An excellent portrayal of village life and tragedy in Germany at the end of WW2. And a beautiful restoration of the original B/W print.
1,Great fun for my son.
1,"I love this children's show, the song and dance of these little adorable characters is excellent and their adventures are most fun.  This show is always on a positive note and is cute and cool at the same time.  Both my sons loved this show from the time they were 3 until 8 yrs old, heck I love it!"
1,Love it!
1,"Just watched Sneaky Pete 3 nights ago.....Hadn't looked far enough ahead to see that it was only 1 episode long, so far! So disappointed that we couldn't watch more. Loved the show. Loved the characters and the actors playing them. I could see SO much potential for further scripting. Can't wait to see more!!"
0,"Trashy,nudity and making no sense to me. Stopped watching after first episode.  Will not recommend."
1,Wow
1,SDFSDFSDFSDFSD
1,It was a pleasant surprise.  I really great movie.
1,"I really love this series, but by far the best season was season 1."
1,Love this show.  So sad that it wasn't allowed to finish properly !
1,Love weird al.  This movie is classic.  So many quotable lines!
1,"Great workout, when you are short on time."
1,"From the writing, casting, acting, direction and right through to the editing, this is, season to season, the best show ever on television."
1,I loved this one.  It is such a sweet story.  I would watch it again.
1,Simply the best. Many of the storylines from each episode have potential to be their own feature length film!
1,"Though I thought it not possible the second season of Young Justice outdid the first season. Easily one of my favorite seasons of television, animated or otherwise."
1,Loved it want to see more
1,I love this show!!
1,Great series!!  Wishing season 4 and 5 were free too.
1,Too bad it was Paul Walkers last
1,Lot of fun. We really enjoyed it!
1,okay
1,"My husband and I watched it together, and we are hooked. It's one of the few shows we both love! Can't wait for season two!!"
1,Good action packed movie
1,"BOSCH is the best series Amazon Prime has come up with to date.  I look forward to seeing season 2.  I have been a fan of Michael Connelly's books for years now.  I've read all of them and for many years I've wanted to see Bosch on TV, but always had a trepidation on who would play him.  Excellent choice in Titus Welliver.  I can't think of a single role I have not liked him in, whether he be playing bad guy or good.  He does a great job bringing Bosch to life.  Just the right amount of gravitas and strength.  Like I said, can't wait for season 2."
1,Love this show!
1,Excellent show with an historical perspective.
1,Needs more substance.
1,Gritty story of the building of the transcontinental railroad.
1,"This movie was silly-however when you watch it with a kid who will laugh at anything (he thought Box Trolls was good), it was a cute movie. Seriously the part with one of the cops in a cape still makes me laugh, I'd watch it again."
1,Was an excellent series and last episode was outstanding!
1,I love this show
1,"My Grandaughter loves this show.  She learns, sings, and dances with Daniel and friends. The Legacy of Mr Rodgers lives onâ˜ºï¸"
1,Cute show! Educational and entertaining.
1,It was alright
1,Love this series.  My husband even got hooked on it.
1,"This movie is only funny if you're looking for ridiculously stupid humor.  That being said, I remember it as being a hilarious movie when I was younger.  I rented it to watch with my 18 and 13 year old kids - they just thought it was stupid.  I will always remember it at corny humor, they didn't even finish it."
1,You really can't tell who would stay and who would go in the beginning. The camera guys really are the best part. Much respect to them.
1,Thought this was a pretty good movie!  Kate Winslet is such a good actress !
1,Hope this makes it past the preview stage. Good characters and story line
1,My 4 year old loves this show!
1,Great show!
1,Like is show
1,Watched the mini series years ago. Great to have the series available on Amazon Prime. Just got satellite for our cottage. Movies came through clear and without interruption using &#34;Amazon Instant Video.&#34; Who needs cable.
1,It is so hard to find a movie that is a nice surprise.  This Clark Gable south seas adventure movie is one of them.  Highly recommended.
1,"Funny, cute, but the season was over way too quickly."
1,Love it
1,"Even if you are already familiar with the cases being discussed, this series focuses on the details of the forensic techniques utilized. Extremely informative."
1,"Man, this was just as funny as I remembered it.  Who could not watch it again.  So many cameos ."
1,Now and then a show comes along that makes me happier just knowing it exists I don't have to be watching it but knowing it's there is a light in a dark world this is one of those shows
1,"Great writing, definitely a good show!"
1,"a small film that speaks volumes. A  story about loan sharks,enforcers, addicts and the possibility of escape. Well written, an exceptional if small ensemble that has fine direction, cinematography and a sensitive soundtrack.. The heavy is outstanding but my favorite dialogue belongs to his girl who describes the pitfalls of involuntary sleep deprivation. The lead is understated while the vortex spins around him like a hurricane. Lastly Manhattan is shot beautifully while the locations still bare its grit."
1,A really good belly laugh! The mixed up parodies keep you thinking which is difficult while LMAO!
1,Excellent and mind twisting!
1,Great season!!!
1,Excellent screenplay!
1,Love this movie!!!
1,Dabney is the Bomb! Consummate role as a supreme jerk from an authentically nice guy.
1,Great movie
0,watched about the first 20 mins and then turned it off.  Waste of $3.  the acting was horrible and the whole thing was corny
0,They were trying to hard.
1,It is slow at first but it get better
1,Burt was top shelf!  Old style on this - but quality!  Prison story.
1,My 5 and 8 year old boys have been incredibly inspired by this show! They love it!!! It has a lot of valuable lessons and somehow figured out how to make kids curious and wanting to learn more! It's a treat for them to watch and me to observe them!
0,Boring
1,Intriguing  behind the scenes look at the creative process of  high stakes fashion design with reputations and billions ($$$) at stake.
1,A nicely balanced film -- and based on true events!
1,My 3 yo asks for it by name
1,Better than Season 1 but not as good as Season 3
1,"Great show,sorry its over."
1,Funny and really out there! My husband and I watched the whole first series in one seating. Awesome
1,"Very entertaining. Strong writing and believable characters. Still, not Foyle!"
0,Very boring. Nothing like The Walking Dead. Waste of money.
1,Great
1,Love this movie!
1,Great story line and excellent acting
1,Great
1,Interesting and fun family entertainment that sneaks in a little true information here and there.
1,It's ok
1,I love Julia Roberts so of course I love this movie. A feel-good romantic comedy that has a happy ending. This would be a great &#34;Girl's Night&#34; movie!
1,Another excellent series by Aaron Sorkin.  Love the characters
1,"Very disappointed the show didn't get renewed for a second season. Very enjoyable, a little silly but aren't we all?"
1,"Captured me from the start with camera work and intensity. Kids keep interrupting me so the pilot is paused AGAIN, but added to my list of shows I plan to follow!"
1,All 3 of my children have been watchers of The Big Comfy Couch! It's a show we enjoy watching together. Good wholesome fun with excellent morals thrown in.
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»
0,"I rarely rate anything, but this was so bad I had to comment.  I have enjoyed both the stars of this show in other works and thought that despite poor reviews and box office, it would probably be at least mildly amusing.<br />The terrible script and editing (they didn't even try) were bad enough but for both lead actresses to fail so miserably was a surprise. These two are capable of very good work but like the editor, didn't even try...and it showed."
1,"If you're an Entourage fan and kept up with the series, you'll love this movie.  They stay true to the storyline and characters and it's cool how they brought back some of the original characters who had cameos throughout the season.<br />If you never saw an episode of Entourage, you probably won't understand or like this movie very much."
1,"I love The Walking Dead,  Fear The Walking Dead is great also and will be another  'Monster' hit."
1,Awesome
1,A very funny cartoon from my childhood that I get to share with my children.
1,The kid made the movie great.
1,Larry David knocks it out of the park!
1,So much fun! (Even after all these years!!)
1,My favorite show.
1,Project Runway is my favorite show; I've been watching the show since it began.  My all-time favorite challenges are the unconventional and the couturier challenge.  Itâ€™s amazing to see the creativity each designer brings to the table each season.  As long as Iâ€™ve been watching this show each season brings forth fresh and new designs.  This seasonâ€™s unconventional challenge was absolutely a show stopper.  One of the designers created a wedding dress from Hallmark cards.  The dress was stunning!!!!!!<br />Love this show.
1,Good storyline
1,Good
1,Excellent all around.
1,"I'd like to see more. Great actors, enjoyable if not original premise."
1,The absolute best series out there!
1,"Entertaining, some that's not a cop or doctor or lawyer show"
1,It's an all around wonderful sisterly love movie
1,"Awesome move, shed some tears but worth it."
1,Really good clean movie.
1,Interesting to see fanatics from different religions
1,Great show!
1,poor picture quality
1,A great western movie.
1,"I do love it.  Come on, there has to be more than one episode.  Don't leave me hanging.  I want to see how he weasels out of his predicament."
0,Could not follow this film. Lots of backtracking and chattering about his lose of memory. Wouldn't recommend unless you have lots of patience and no other films to watch... downright boring
1,"Other than Clint 'winking', it's a pretty good movie"
1,"Excellent guide for Italy. Rick Steves really knows what he's talking about when it comes to Italy, and this guide was immensely readable and enjoyable."
1,"My husband and I enjoyed the characters, especially the different love stories. Anytime forgiveness is highlighted the plot is a good one. My husband is really interested in politics and the media, so this show was a good representation for both for him."
1,Typical Luc Besson.  Mostly eye candy and sloppy filmmaking.  Miss Scarlet is quite beautiful.  Freeman acts well with his usual ease.
1,"This was an OK movie.  The underlying message, that James Franco's character was using Jonah Hill's, didn't come across too clearly.  Had that been made more forcefully, the movie would have been hard to beat.  As it is, the movie is OK."
1,"Predicable plot.....A little slow at times, but I'd watch again just for the pink mist shots"
0,The movie is more based as a reality show like.  I did not like it.
1,Love it!  Each character has a unique bio-personalities!
1,i love this show!
1,Dmx enough said
1,Funny
1,"IT IS NOT THE QUALITY OF &#34; BREAKING BAD&#34;, BUT  SOME REAL TWISTS & TURNS.  IT CERTAINLY USES UP THE BULLETS LIKE AGOOD OL' WESTERN !  LOVE THE MAIN CHARACTER, TIMATHOY OYLPHANT, AS HE PLAYS THAT PART SO WELL!"
0,"Boring, Sillicon valley is better"
0,"I really liked the book.  The movie was just &#34;meh&#34;.  I thought the actors did a nice job.  However,  I felt that the screenplay just sucked all the life out of the story.<br /><br />I get that screenplay writers need to severely edit a novel.  I get that things are going to be out of order and combined.  Usually it's not a big deal.  In this movie, I just felt like they missed the mark.  They missed so many critical moments and focused on others way too much.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to seeing the movie after reading the book.  It was such a disappointment."
1,Interesting beginning.  I would like to see more .
1,I need more episodes!
1,Excellent show!
1,Ahhh yaaa
1,Mribeth Monroe is so funny as Alice. All around great show.
1,Well thought out and atmospheric.  Not exactly connolly's Bosch but close enough.  Welliver holds his scenes by internal acting.  Not chatty.  Lots of LA shots.  Good support acting.  Can't wait for Season 2!
1,Hilarious
1,Enjoyable. But why do aliens that travel interstellar and galactic distances not see humans hiding behind rubble and trees. Infrared anyone!
1,Definitely the best series out there.
1,love it
1,One of the better seasons ... and there are no bad seasons.
1,Not for me
1,Awesome!
1,There are some  things better left alone...... one is for scientists to bring the dead back to life. What they can't figure into the equation is the after effects that are horrifyingly real and totally unexpected. This is one experiment that really went hay wire to their deadly dismay!!!
1,Enjoyed it very much.
1,I can't wait to see Season 5 without havng to pay for it!
1,Clint is always fantastic
0,A bit too racey
1,"Referring to ALL the seasons, I LOVE this series! I especially enjoy the personal interaction between Lewis and Hathaway. And the chemistry between Lewis and Laura. (I bet I'm not the only one hoping for a marriage &#34;down the road.&#34;) I would like to see more focus on Lewis' family. He has at least one daughter, right? (Kim?) I hope this series continues for many more years. P.S. I loved Inspector Morris and was saddened to learn he died &#34;in real life.&#34;"
1,Funny and spooky at the same time  well acted
1,Interesting Premise. Great movie about escaping New York only to realize that you are still trapped by your own essential nature.
1,Nice story.
0,Less talk and more van please!
1,"Great film! Superb action scenes, and I loved the plot.  There were a few inconsistencies and weird parts of the film, but overall I loved it."
1,Great Series!
0,Just saw the first few minutes.  Too much sex.
0,SILLY
1,One of my favorite King novels so I of course like the show
1,"Very witty and clever plot, horrifying and funny at the same time.  Excellent performances by Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve.  Never a dull moment once the momentum starts to build.<br /><br />Loved it."
1,Excellent documentary about the people who actually made a difference in the war that most are forgetting. Highly recommend.
0,Skip it.
1,very entertaining
1,This guy has got a formula yet it's still unpredictable and hilarious.
1,"Masterpiece of visuality and phantasmagoria!  Even though I didn't quite get the ending, it's great entertainment"
1,Just found this series a few weeks back. It is a must watch.
1,Love this series.  I wish all police would put this kind of thought into their actions.
1,Hilarious! Extremely Funny!
0,B..ish movie.  Bad acting.  Story line was interesting.
1,excellent  almost for whole family viewing. Granddaughter  loves to watch the tricks the show comes up with
1,"I never watched this show when it first aired, so Amazon Prime has given me an opportunity to catch the episodes in proper order.  I started watching it upon the urging of my daughter.  I quickly became immersed in the characters and the detailed universe they inhabit.  Like the best science fiction programs, Stargate SG-1, creates fantastic worlds and scenarios and relatable human beings confronting seemingly unimaginable situations.  Season 2 improves upon the outstanding inaugural season.  Now I am looking forward to caching up with the remaining seasons with my daughter!"
1,Enjoyable!
1,Feel good family movie. No worries about bad language/scene.
1,Great movie
1,SO GOOOOOOOOD!
1,Like it
1,"Apparently for anyone who has worked on a reality TV show, as the creator has, this show has unparalleled authenticity.  Shiri Appleby and Constance Zimmer have fabulous chemistry for their dysfunctional, effective partnership.  Don't know how this show ended up on Lifetime, but it's to Lifetime what Breaking Bad was to AMC."
1,Re-watching Stargate Atlantis and the show really holds up.  Hard to believe how long ago that show was on.  The series has non-stop action and the periodic visits from Stargate-SG-1 personnel keep it interesting.  Our only complaint about Amazon Instant Video is the tiling during streaming.  Not the quality we've grown used to.
1,Worth watching but would have appreciated to be more in depth and detailed.
0,"Expected more!  Kevin Bacon was great, the young boys however, weren't very good at all!"
1,Really good movie
1,"I don't know why, but my granddaughter loves this!!"
1,"If you like John Lacarre', you'll like these as well."
1,"Cute movie, clean, nice storyline. Natalie Wood does an excellent job in portrayal of the young girl."
1,This centuries Freinds
0,slow
1,great funny show
1,Very good
1,Very violent. Compelling plot. Would have been more engaging to me with more plot / showing of her abilities at different levels and less violence.
1,One of my favorite shows!
0,"Alex Garland has had a great track record for movies, as I've likes most of what he's written. Sunshine, 28 Days Later, Dredd, all of them are on my list of favorite movies ever. So when I heard about his directorial debut, Ex Machina, I was really looking forward to seeing it. I was going to see it in theaters, but instead I went and watched  Mad Max: Fury Road for the millionth time.<br /><br />I do not regret that decision, especially now.<br /><br />I should say that I rather enjoyed Ex Machina for a majority of its run time. The cinematography is breathtaking, the atmosphere unsettling, and the tone is perfectly cerebral.<br /><br />It's also the single most stupid movie I've seen in recent years. While I said that the film is cerebral, it's more of a feeling than an actual facet of the film's story. This movie wants so hard to be a thought provoking piece of science fiction, and I applaud Garland and company for aspiring to be that, but they failed. Plain and simple. Between the obvious commentary on Google, and the story rehashed from the mother of all artificial intelligence stories: Frankenstein, the film's attempts to look like it's smart betrays its real intelligence. And no amount of sexy female robot nudity is going to help.<br /><br />Without spoiling much of the movie, as I'm sure many wouldn't want it spoiled the general gist of the film is: if you're a jerkass, don't be surprised if the artificial intelligence you create ends up being a jerkass too. That, in and of itself, isn't enough to make this film bad, but I certainly had higher expectations for this film. Maybe that's my fault, though given how amazing a majority of the film is I was expecting a few more twists than the ones the film dished out, and they all ended up being rather predictable.<br /><br />Needless to say, if this film were a computer, and I were the person conducting the Turing Test, I'd fail it. It's still a simulation of something wondrous and amazing rather than the genuine article.article."
1,My kids liked it.  Funny and entertaining.  Its always nice to find a movie that you can enjoy with your kids.
1,Catastrophe is one of the best shows I've seen in awhile. Rob and Sharon do a great job of blending humor and heart.
1,Okay.  Not much of a story.  More of a silly comedy.
1,Great show!
1,Such an amazing show. I can't believe season 6 will be the last season! I'm so sad! I watched season 5 much too quickly.
1,Honestly loved this movie. I mean it did give off the vibe of 10 things I hate about you but it was still pretty good. I'd watch this again.
1,Way awesome action movie!
1,"Very entertaining gangster movie that can be watched again and again.<br />Great actiong!  Not only the awesome lead roles, Minsik Choi & Jungwoo Ha, but also the film was filled with vivid supporting actors, famous scene stealers: Jinwoong Jo, Dongsuk Ma, Sungkyun Kim, & Dowon Kwak....<br />Highly recommend it."
1,"This is one of my favorite Masterpiece stories. Not only are Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson very talented and terrific actors, the story is superb. I love how Ross Poldark is a trooper for fairness of the poor and underprivileged. This is a wonderful period piece and I look forward to Season 2."
1,Non-preachy thinkalot type of movie with believable characters tormented by extremely painful circumstances.
1,Loved it! Awesome!
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
1,It is a great show. The main actress really pulls it off
1,"Fun, sublime and a bit nauthy"
1,"Keeps you involved, great costumes"
1,Awesome!!  Please bring on the series !!!  Don't delay!!
1,Always fun
1,"If you know the show its 5 stars, if not, go watch season 1 (which deserves 6 stars alone).<br /><br />This season is shaping up to have less WTF moments established in the first season, but the familiarity is allowing the show to go a few more places it didn't last season. Still shaping up to be great."
1,I think this is a great show!
1,"I love TBG but second season isn't the prime yet, still, very good."
1,He does a great review of the history of the apostate church.
1,Outstanding action that moves very quickly keeping you glued to your chair.
1,Good old movie.
1,Excellent show!
1,Slightly uneven start leads to a very satisfying conclusion to a great show's maiden season.
1,good movie
1,I never thought that watch this serie again.<br />Remind me when I was a little kid.<br />Thank you Amazon.
1,"Pretty good series at the beginning.  Now it seems like they are running out of ideas to cause drama in this woman's life.  A normal person most likely would have said screw it, moved to a different state or country, and changed their name by now :-("
1,"Very thoughtful movie.  Good acting, somewhat predictable, but otherwise cleaver plot"
1,My 26 month old granddaughter loves this show. Perfect entertainment for her! ðŸ˜Š
1,"Great special, love Patton."
1,Enjoyed the ending!
1,Well done!
1,Perfect addition to the Genre.
1,Love it just as much as season one.
1,Cute movie
1,Very captivating show
1,I made out with my girlfriend for 3 hours once this this movie finished. Now we are getting married. Its definitely a lady killer!
1,"Well done Amazon, TV worth watching."
1,Beautiful family friendly movie
1,Should be required viewing!
1,Great series!
1,"My 3.5 year old girls love it, the language is great for girls!!!!"
1,great acting and good storyline
1,I loveeeeeeeeee this show OMG 5 stars all the way
1,Not as good as some of the other films. Don't like how they made superman Zods son!
1,Good movie.
0,Didn't finish watching it.
1,"I repeat, Anticipating, UR nex series!!!!"
1,It is pretty good movie. I will see it over and over again
1,"Once you get past the cheesy, corny dialogue and mediocre acting it is a very sweet and cute film at heart."
1,Amazing !
1,It was entertaining.  I read the book and wanted to see if the movie was like the book.
1,This is a great
1,great cast and a good story. wish there was a 2nd season
1,Still great
1,"Have only watched half of the first episode, maybe it will get better."
1,Great first season!
0,"Poorly acted, terribly paced, cringe-worthy humor, and utterly uninteresting. Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic until she has to interact with someone - she has almost zero chemistry with the rest of the cast. Some of the visuals are interesting, but not good enough to make the movie worth watching for the spectacle."
0,Horrible.. Waste of my time
1,Great show with lots of empathy.
1,Kids love it.
1,One of the great WWII stories well told in this film.  I studied this operation when I was a lieutenant in the Army.  The film captures many of the mistakes made in the planning and execution of Market Garden.
1,I love old westerns.
1,"A really pleasant and entertaining competition show to watch.  I learned a lot about baking, was engrossed with the contestant's successes and failures and did not miss one bit of the manufactured drama of American reality shows.  I am a huge &#34;Real Housewives&#34; and &#34;American Ninja Warrior&#34; fan and this mild reality competition is a fresh change from those drama filled affairs.  Watch this!"
0,It was like &#34; the poor man's Chef
0,Worst movie ever.
1,Carpenter wrote a movie about america today way back in the day!
0,Really bad movie!
1,"It is always bittersweet for me when a series that I have been involved in for several seasons comes to an end.<br /><br />I knew it was coming; I knew this was the final season.  But you always wonder how it will end...will it leave with a cliff hanger and unanswered questions, or neatly tie things up in a wonderful package so that you can imagine what happens next.<br /><br />I am so very glad that this series did just that!!  I will not say anything further; don't want to spoil anything for those who have not yet watched the series, or the series finale.  But thank you, Falling Skies for the ride!  I can see so much of this as plausible, tho I truly doubt that anything like this will ever really happen.  I think that we as a &#34;civilized&#34; world of humans are more likely to annihilate ourselves before aliens from another universe do it for us!!"
0,A bit too long and Very Hollywood
1,Take care to remember that this is a re-imagining of the books rather than a retelling. The ending was perfect & beautiful in the way only monsters can be.
1,Pretty Cool Man
1,best tv show!!!
1,not as good as first one
1,I wish this series would cover all of Peter Robinson's wonderful DCI Banks novels.
1,scary
1,A  Great series
1,It's tempting to binge watch!
1,Great show!
1,"I really enjoyed Orphan Black Season 1. I was surprised, I only watched it because I was caught up on all my other shows. Great villians, lots of action and great acting."
1,The whole series is great and season three just brings more of the great commentary of the times.
1,"Got this for our Grandson, we all enjoyed the movie.."
1,Yup
1,great show
0,"we were disappointed. for such a dynamic man, this documentary was NOT!"
1,I loved these as a kid why wouldn't I like them now.  Bronson is the original tough guy the only one I like better is Clint!  If you've never seen the death wish movies I recomend you do.
1,Awesome show that I enjoyed when it first premiered.  Larry David is hilarious.
1,"Very interesting WWII piece, longer than I thought, and complex."
1,Great movie
1,Action packed at times
1,Annedroids is an awesome show! I hope season 3 is in the works.
1,"Great series of a new take on getting the truth from evil doers.  Fun, fast dialogue.  Interesting situations, crimes and interpersonal relationships within the cast.  All of the characters have interesting back stories.  The study of reading faces and the minutiae of muscle movements, expressions is fascinating.  You just might be able to apply these insights to your own life!  The cast is brilliant.  Highly recommend these videos."
0,Horrifically violent.
1,I'm sad that it was the last season.....
1,Very exciting series. Enjoyed watching all the seasons.
1,"If you like old movies with singing and dancing, this fits the bill!  Few ever were better dancers than Fred Astaire.  A silly story line and script merely link the dance numbers.  It is sometimes fun go back 50+ years and see a different world.  This movie serves that purpose!"
1,"Excellent movie, but depressing. Still worth watching."
1,Very  entertaining. enjoyed the music and beautiful costumes.
1,Family can be positive or toxic.  This movie illustrates both.  Loved it!!!
1,it's okay
1,Loved this movie! Helped me work on my &#34;Liam Niesson&#34; imitation!
1,Boring....predictable
1,Great
1,"Strong story line, good performances. Dialogue was somewhat contrived however."
1,SyFy still has not come up with shows as good as SG1 and Stargate Atlantis.
0,A bit predictable. Flying scenes were fine.  Best part was the credit role: no fortresses were harmed in the filming of this movie......
1,moving and powerful
0,"Poor acting, bad special effects, not what I expected, and as a Lovecraft fan found it quite cheesy."
1,VERY funny and exciting.  Loved the movie.
1,Every season and almost every episode hits home. I love how they show life how it really is.
1,Great movie
1,My son loves this show. I wish there were more episodes. We've already watched this one at least 20 times!
1,Love this show...so real and so funny...just like life! Can't wait to watch the rest of the series.
1,"The movie was good and the acting was first rate, especially the performance of Al Pacino. The plot was compelling and engaging. However, it was too long. I think that they could shave one-half hour off."
1,Love this!!
1,It was ok. I like the actors but the show kind of lags.
1,"This fillm is a hoot with some very recognizable stars and one comic actor Bruce Campbell who's weirdness makes this doubly enjoyable.  This was made when horror and comedy were enjoined by some great scriptwriters, directors and producers who had a unique sense of humor in the tradition of guys like Mel Brooks.  You'll be sorry if you don't watch this one!"
1,Great series
1,This is a fantastic series....I'm so sorry I didn't watch it in real time and so disappointed the series had to end.  It was a snippet of I believe things are done in a newsroom with a personal touch added.  Brought up so real news that carries on even today.  Bring it back!!!
0,Don't be tempted by the outstanding cast. This move is disappointing to say the least. A complete flop. Should've been so much more.
1,great story line
1,"Not your typical West Virginia family, and very over exaggerated. But very funny."
1,WOW!  And what a tribute.
1,great
1,Son loves it & watches over & over!
1,I want more.  Hurry!!!
0,"Absolutely awful. This movie makes the movie &#34;zombie strippers&#34; look like Lawrence Arabia. The acting Is awful, the plot is awful. The cinematography is unbelievably bad.  everything is awful. You have to see it to believe it."
0,Early Pryor just working out his stick nothing like  later Pryor
1,Love this movie. Timeless.
1,Liked this original series well enough despite the over-use of certain slang words. I'd like to see more shows like this.  Shows that are ficticious accounts of various industries.  I'd like to see one about the art world and galleries that handle the art stars.
1,"I wouldn't call this groundbreaking, or even inspired, but it IS entertaining, and somewhat funny. I recommend."
1,Better than I expected.
1,It's like a prehistoric nightmare of fragmented personality.
1,"Cute movie.  Funny, good to watch on a night when you just need something light and fun."
1,One of best series I've ever watched and so glad I bought Amazon Prime to watch TV series.
1,Great television.
1,Awesome and inspiring!!<br />Eye opening!!
1,Daughter loves it
1,"What a colossal improvement over MI 1,2, and 3. Much better characters, story, etc.  I saw MI1 at the movies, and thought it was OK - not great, not bad. Then I saw MI2 at the movies and decided not to see another MI movie - truly horrible. I heard MI3 was better, and it was, although it wasn't great. Then MI 4 - the characters were interesting. It was a very good action movie.  Much improved."
0,"The trailer is misleading. It promises a traditional/simple romantic comedy. Instead this film tries to fit several genres and doesn't succeed in any of them due to the lack of character development and storyline.<br /><br />There were 4 different stories going on in the movie and none of them seemed plausible or interesting.<br /><br />1. Bradley Cooper returns to Hawiia to prove himself/succeed in business. (His reputation is good enough that he is on this job, and everyone trusts him to handle tricky issues at hand.But all the characters in the movie feel entitled to say what a jerk he is...Huh?)<br /><br />2. Hawiian people are mistreated by the government and conned by Cooper/Murray. (Yeah this storyline really never goes anywhere and seems more a political statement by the writer.)<br /><br />3. The romantic storyline between Stone and Cooper. She is obnoxious and Uncharming. (She is a female Sheldon Cooper.) He seems more interested in his Ex.<br /><br />4. McAdams and Cooper resolving the past and accepting the present. Both seem very happy in their present circumstances, so it made no sense why after 13 years they would meet up. (What drove these 2 characters to come together at that moment versus 13 years ago or 20 years from the present?)<br /><br />And after all the revelations to tie up all 4 plots, everyone is EXTREMELY RELAXED. I would have thought more yard decorations would be decapitated."
1,Can't get enough!
1,Very funny
1,"Love Hidalgo - great flick! Lotsa heart, lotsa fun. Great acting from all - great script. It's not The Godfather - that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Great flick - well worth the watch :) If this review helps - gimme a 'Like' - I like to know if I'm getting through to you. Thanks!"
1,Not being of religious nature I really enjoy it. It made an impression on my way of thinking about the Bible.
1,Surprisingly funny and deep dark comedy.
1,Actors are fantastic!
1,Tear jerker
1,Kind of hard to. Follow
1,Classic battles!
0,"This movie stunk...I dont think Z or Zachariah is even mentioned once in the movie. If it is a hidden meaning or reference, then it was not obvious, and although the acting was good, I do not see myself taking even 2 seconds out of my day to try a research it. Dont watch"
1,"A thoughtful (instead of superhero) quest story that explores the Greeks' relationships with their gods.  Fresh well-done take, which is not easy to do, on characters from several Greek myths.  Matt Frewer as Daedalus is well cast.  If you've ever enjoyed a play by Sophocles, you'll find many of the same themes here.  However, if you're not sure who Sophocles is, this may not be a series for you.  I've read reviews that criticize the special effects--well, I didn't notice problems with them and this series is not really about the special effects.  It pulls the viewer in the old fashioned way--with great dramatic pacing and ideas."
1,"Charming, light sarcasm.  Good character acting. Background itself is a character."
1,Amazing. A series NOT steeped in sex and graphic violence. A  refreshing change!
1,"It wasn't 'til I spotted Angus Scrimm in a cameo that it occurred to me this was a Don Coscarelli film. Scrimm's presence isn't the only thing that will remind you of the Phantasm films. If you liked them, you'll love this one!!!"
0,amazon streaming no longer works properly.  No problems with Netflix streaming
1,Great movie. Keeps you entertained for the whole movie. I would recommend it to people who enjoy these period type shows.
1,great & great for kids
1,Great Movie for the kids - this one stands the test of time!
0,Slow build to not much...
1,Love them!
1,This movie was so good. Had unexpected things happen in it that made it a must watch!
0,The movie is great but play back was really bad amazon kept fading out the movie kept freezing and stopping I checked my connection and it was fine so amazon needs to fix there server or I won't be renting anymore movies
1,It was great - we need more episodes now
1,"The movie was an eye opener. It's scary to think how much medical science is hidden from the public to keep unhealthy food available for high profits. I'm not going to get political. I have Coronary Artery Disease. I watch my diet much more than before. This is the best life choice for healthy eating, meal prep takes a long time at first. I had to give myself a little time to get the routine straight, i.e. shopping, read more labels, being creative. If you have Coronary Artery Disease you have to consider this food change."
1,"the difference here is the style. So its a little shorter then jason bourne on action; but in a way that is critical, realistic. It pictures the reality of what it means to be set up. Not understanding the narrative of the situation, but understanding the need to hunt out, and find a solution, a resolution. Is the daughter a tack on? Absolutely. Does it pay off? Certainly. Other considerations for this movie are not so much on tacky elements, so much as highlighting highly professional and elusive criminal syndicates.<br /><br />A few tactics were over-hung for &#34;heroes&#34; but this movie for me personified a lot of the fear related to the circumstances. You're riding the line of somewhere between crazy idiot and mastermind. Revealing secrets in products and highlighting genuine circumstances of corporate neglect [in some elements] onto more or less complete corporate betrayal. The super-human element stands out for hero, as always. But that said, the scenarios he plays out of are very &#34;real&#34; in a &#34;what would you do?&#34; kind of way.<br /><br />I think the notion of erased/burned was a bit forced on the title, but only because forewarning spoiler: [look away!] cia inside job [k you can look back]<br /><br />For a corporate espionage, and betrayal film there was little investment to care. Not in a lack of the depth of the characters on screen, but the lack of characters that were off. There's always a fourth wall kinda character, and that more or less in parts onto this film an ever convenient taint of daddy slept with other women in the air.<br /><br />Kill a couple hours, you're going to anyway. :p I'd say worth it, but I threw in the towel on expectations at Dad can't work a laundry machine but can figure out how to dissolve sophsticated department of justice lock mechanisms.<br /><br />... I swear I still enjoyed the movie!"
1,This historical series was well done. It was very entertaining.
1,Sweet story with interesting characters
1,Great writing. Good fun.
1,Great movie ending was phenobarbital
1,We had been looking for a light comedy with half-hour episodes. This first season is definitely a cut above the stupid sitcoms that dominate this niche. We are delighted that there will be at least one more season for us to enjoy on Amazon Prime.
1,I am enjoying watching the past seasons of Survivor  It's a great show.
1,Still great after all these years. My 9 and 12 year old girls watched it for the first time last week!
1,Super Great movie!! Everyone inAmerica should be required to watch. Certainly changed my feelings toward the Mexican people.
1,"Great. Nothing like it today, unfortunately."
1,okay
1,"This was a great comedic performance by Will & Kevin. There were some slow parts but for the most part, they had me laughing hard."
1,Just a few weeks ago I couldn't even last near a mile on my other video by Leslie Sansone. I have literally sat on my butt for the past ten years. I quit smoking 3 years ago and gained a ton or so. I loathed myself for letting myself go to such a degree. So now with a Fitbit and Leslie's videos I can go further every day without my legs folding under me and now being able to breathe instead of panting like a puppy.. I have lost 25 pounds in a little over two months and I feel pretty darned good!

1,the best series I had watched since Fringe.  If you love Twilight Saga then you will love this one.
0,"Awful, dreadful & and overall, shockingly bad!"
0,"Can't believe Samuel l Jackson made such a bad movie.  Special effects were 3rd rate, acting was 3rd rate, strange plot, etc.  Not worth the $5 I spent for it."
1,"just old so the quality was not great, but funny material for sure!"
1,bold but intersting
1,It was a good movie
1,Heart-warming and realistic
1,"Good, Pacino is great!"
0,I didn't enjoy watching the movie and it appears to be a low budget movie.
1,Very well done first rate acting
1,Wonderful series. We really have enjoyed it. We are on season 5 and looking forward to season 6.
1,Great show in the spirit of Stargate SG-1
1,Funny.  Great comic chemistry between Ferrell and Hart.
1,ITS KIND OF ADDICTIVE!
1,"I love Daniel tiger because not only does it teach my daughter how to handle her emotions, it teaches parents how to act when your kids are acting up. My daughter has been watching since age 2, now 3, and loves it"
1,One of my favorite shows on tv. I like the fact that I can watch it any time. Great season!
1,Dope
1,Better than Seinfeld!!!
1,Very enertaining
0,Dumb ending ... they should have stopped at 6

1,I enjoyed the story line.
1,Loved it!
1,Good Show....
1,Very Good Movie!
1,"I'm really into dark tech type shows like this.<br />This is one of the best new TV series I've watched this summer.<br />If you're interested in dark-tech type shows that keeps you on the edge of your chair,<br />this one's for you."
1,I loved the tv series. This movie sheds light in some dark areas
1,"A little slow,drawn out, but the story is very good."
1,loved loved loved this. The father son relationship is so beautiful! good for laughs and tears.
0,Terrible
1,One of the best.
1,Positively awe-inspiring.  Leaves you with chills.  Anne Hathaway's performance was stunning.
1,Great show..even with the excessive profanity..which eventually become immune to.  Very disappointed that it came to a sudden end...without closure.
0,Too boring to finish - glad I didn't pay to rent it
1,It was an enjoyable movie for me and my wife.  It helped us to think through some of the more difficult questions of life.  Embracing the message of this movie could be the difference between success and failure in life.
1,Was a fun movie!
1,Love the English mysteries.
1,Looking forward to seeing more.
0,Why is this even a thing? I wish this was someone just wanting to advance a cause instead of someone wanting to outshock his daughters
1,Hidden Agenda
1,Fantastic show! Wish it was still on
1,"Light, funny, Ray talking about life.  Hilarious insights.  Male vs female.  Early, comedy that develops as he gets his sitcom."
1,Gotta have this movie
1,So cute!!
1,Very interesting
1,"Lovely movie, enjoyed it very much!"
1,Great show
1,"Interesting they tried to find out heroes identities from old photo (actual footage) with new technique, very very cool!"
1,"One of the best series ever. Writing is phenomenal and series gets more interwoven as it continues to progress. Even though the series is over 10 years old it remains current, maybe more so given what's happened in Baltimore recently."
1,"Excellent artwork and animation, soundtrack done well, plot is a significantly modified version of the original, but works for a month seen audience. The apes are a treat."
1,It starts out a bit slow and then draws you in. A story of the real 007.
1,"The series keeps getting better, like the story and performance of the cast.<br />I don't miss any episode."
1,Owesome
1,"I don't know why but I love the Ripley movies.  I have watched them so many times.  I just don't get tired of them.  Matt Damon in the original, The Amazing Mr. Ripley and John Malcovich in this on are excellent.  Great psychological thrillers."
1,Almost as good as the first season of true detective
1,Excellent singing. Predictable plot.
1,"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967.  They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.<br /><br />It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's.  Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.<br /><br />Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
0,C moive with a weak story line and crappy acting//
1,Great premise and excellent acting. Can't wait to see how the story takes off
1,Enjoyed the concept of the movie and the execution. Would that PILL existed. It could change the world.
1,Very good .
1,Great show....I will miss the characters also
1,Good movie without excess violence
0,characters not believeable
1,It is the best.  Loved it!
1,Really liked it.
1,Good movie. Cute teenage flick with humor and a love story
1,"Romanticized story about a brilliant (according to the script), self-destructive addict. Keeps your interest but the devastation of addiction - to the addict and those who love him - is presented as a necessary, worthwhile suffering means to an end. The implication is the partner would not have acted, in the end, as he did without the impetus of tragedy."
1,Love the characters
0,After seeing Disney's this is terrible.
1,"I wasn't sure of this show at first.  Seemed a bit slow, but they did pick up the pace.  Occasionally, they do get into the characters heads but they haven't lost their way (yet).  What usually ruins a show is when they get away from the action to get deep into the characters.  Blah.  I want believable SCI-Fi action and they deliver.  Although, I'm not sure how they can &#34;lose&#34; a space station...."
1,Enjoyable
1,"I love this movie!! It has a perfect balance of biblical reference combined with horror film creepiness, and the good guy sacrificing himself for the benefit of others. Great story telling and action. Five stars for this gem!!!"
0,So so
1,"Thanks to a few days of free viewing, I was able to watch this last season without trying to piece it together on U-tube. I am not sure I watched it on Amazon as I thought I watched it through my cable when HBO was running a free trial. Where ever it was viewed, it is a great series. I just can't afford to pay HBO's prices or prices per episode or season."
1,great
1,I love this series!
1,"This was just ok. Wouldn't recommend it, but hey tastes are different. Other people may love it, but definitely not my kind of movie."
1,I LOVE THIS SHOW! BETTER THAN DOWNTON ABBEY
1,second time watching the series.
1,This was really quite well done and very informative. The computer graphics are very good; lots of interesting historical tidbits. I recommend it!
1,"Great...funny,funny show"
0,"When the main star a hero, gives up himself to be evil it ruins the series!"
1,"I grew up loving this movie, it is a timeless story with such a strong message- and plenty of laughs!"
0,Boring
0,Not worth the time. Too cheesy.
1,Extant Season 2 once again delivers a great Sci-Fi plot and intriguing story line having characters and situations with lots of &#34;human&#34; appeal. Thank you Amazon Prime!
1,I just started season 1. I'm really enjoying the show so far.
1,One of my favorite movies!
1,Excellent writing; growing to love each unique character; superb acting -- seem very real.
1,Great series premier! Fabulous casting and good writing. I hope they pick Sneaky Pete up for a whole series and have many successful seasons!
1,"Worth watching, but I watched with my spouse and kids and about halfway through we were sort of making fun of it - that said I still cared about the characters enough to see it through -- Good young actors in many roles."
1,my son loves this cartoon
1,I was pleasantly surprised by this one -- a little violent but I really like the Amish angle. Worth watching.
0,Horrible. It is not a story. Is it a reinactment of facts told in a dramtized way imitating a bad Dicovery Channel series. The story is short and they stretch it to its limit with drama. It should be more well discriminated in the summary of the product. Lost my money.
1,"This series snuck up on me.  It was on PBS after Downton Abbey.<br />One episode will have you hooked, but it's an important episode because it introduces the characters.<br />Sydney, the Vicar and Geordy, the cop/detective,  are such an unlikely team but oh, how well they work together.<br />I can only hope there is going to be a second season.<br />Give it a try, you'll be glad you did."
1,"Pleasantly surprised on how well the pilot was along with the actors!. Nothing can compare to the original, The Walking Dead, but this is great and will get me through until October :)"
0,I saw this years ago and remember it having a large impact on me.  Not so much this time.  First time I saw this as a very sad movie.  This time I saw it as an uplifting movie.  There is help.  Nobody needs to have alcohol control them and their lives.
1,loved it.
1,Best TV ever.
1,was just an ok movie
1,Excellent
1,"Fascinating concept, combining actual political events with the drama of a cable newsroom. Well done!"
1,"Rudy Maxa brings real wit and charm to his spot-on travelogues, covering everything from the grandeur of palaces and mountains to the intimate delicacies of the perfect small cafÃ©. They really are &#34;Smart Travels&#34;."
1,This was my favorite movie as a child and it was good to see it available.
0,bad
1,Amazingly hilarious!
1,just wish it was more steamy just like the book and was longer to get everything into it...
1,Love this show.
0,The girl who played Alex was hot but the rest of it was crap. Boring. Yawn. Don't bother.
1,Great show if you like SCI FI
1,Great TV sci fi!
1,Same response as previous. Wonderful!
1,What If....
1,"My 4 yr old daughter loves this, we watch it several times a day!"
1,"A surprising and different twists on the origins of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in this alternate DC universe!"
1,A fun show and informative.
0,THE END WAS SORT OF INCOMPLETE.
1,My 10 yo son gives this 4 stars
1,Delightful movie!
1,Great movie! My 3 year old loves it.
1,Can't wait for season 2
1,"Great series.  Very  acurate.  The clothing is spot on.  The nudity  is a bit much.  I  know that it really happened, but I  wish they had eluded to it instead of showing it."
1,..#waiting on new episode.  Season 25
1,Great show
1,Love Newsroom! The acting is superb!
1,Loved it
1,It's all right.  Didn't like the ending.
1,"4 stars mainly for dance and music, the plot gets a little tedious."
1,My girl loves it
0,"stupid, goofy"
1,Good show
1,Cute and teaches problem solving skills.
1,loved it
1,"Watching it yet again (4th time). Still my number one, despite of some other excellent shows that came up since The Wire wrapped up it's 5th season. Each time I discover something I had missed before, or have forgotten since last time. Omar, Bubbles, McNulty and Major Coleman still my favorite characters... Hmm and Lester Freeman, Kima, Bunk, Randy... ðŸ˜…"
1,"We rented it for our Friday movie night with the kids and were pleasantly surprised, very cute movie."
1,"Really like the show...seeing how the show is produced and having the connection with real events.  The parts focusing on the staff interpersonal relationships is a little lame, but that's OK."
1,A bunch of laugh out loud scenes!!
1,"Really well done, exciting and engaging.  And they aren't afraid to make major changes to the plot and major characters.  I guess for me with the end of season 1 and going into season 2, it started to take on more of a horror aspect which I don't like - I enjoy suspense, action and occasional thrills."
0,Not as funny I was hoping.
1,Very good
1,Always a classic....I've been a fan since a young child and still love to watch this ever-classic television production.
1,Good military movie for those who have served.
1,very good.  I like all things Rome.
1,Brilliant resolution!  Elegant closure to a wonderful version of the tale. Thank you for a visually and psychologically beautiful and grotesque myth.
1,"I love this show, it is one of the best shows ever"
1,I really enjoyed the ending.
0,Ridiculously inept show
1,"The funniest show, ever.  Larry continues to be a victim of circumstance but doesn't let it get him down.  You can tell that actor Larry is having the time of his life and it rubs off on the viewer."
1,A nice documentary about the great people who have chosen to experience the wonder of hiking the AT.
1,Obnoxiously Funny! But again: It is Larry David - creator of &#34;Seinfeld&#34; - George Constanza himself!
0,"Only tolerable if you're into fashion and want to see the clothing. This goes to show that not everyone should have a reality tv show. I'm sure the women are sweet and wonderful in person, but this doesn't always make for a compelling watch. Go organize your own closet or tackle that task you're avoiding by trying to pass the time in other ways."
0,"This had its moments, but from the beginning I felt like I was watching these two doing their impressions of Kristen Wiig and Joaqu&iacute;n Phoenix, and doing it badly. I love Kristen Wiig and her choices of movies, and I really think that Joaqu&iacute;n Phoenix is a good actor, but I can't say the same about these two. Although, Adam Pally is better at it than Sarah Burns is in this, but I have to admit, I have not seen either of them in any other movie (that I am aware of) so I can't really say they are bad actors 100% of the time, only in this. I felt for both of these people they were portraying immediately, I actually cared for them, I had high hopes. About midway through, I stopped caring for her completely, mainly I guess (maybe) it could be that she may actually had been acting so well that her character made me dislike her, but, whatever, I don't think that the makers of this movie wanted that to happen. (The script itself is probably at fault here , so that also means all of those in charge were at fault) In any movie you need to care about the characters, if you go too far and those in charge make you actually stop caring, you are going to be on a very slippery slope, and these slid all of the way down the hill as far as I was concerned. Yes, I do know that Sarah's character was supposed to be this way, but too much is just too much. The character, &#34;Beth&#34; would've been a better choice for Sarah's part, I feel, I liked her more, and she had some acting skills and her and Adam had good chemistry together.<br />The premise for this movie was good enough, I liked the idea, and had it been handled by writers and directors, plus, the actors, just a little better, I would be writing a different review. (I am not a very good reviewer, I only do this if I am 'trying to' help someone either see a good movie, or, stay away from one that may be considered a bad one)<br />Also really, I am not a prude at all, but this had quite a bit of raunchy humor in it that was unnecessary, there is no need to say all of the stuff they said, especially that many times, and I promise, I say those words myself, but for me, in a romantic comedy they should not be raunchy. (That's just how I feel, I am old-fashioned that way) To me, a successful romantic comedy is one like, Sleepless in Seattle, (I know, I know) they did it right, so well in fact, they had immediate copycat movies by others that followed their lead, even the same directors and producers tried to keep that formula going with, You Got Mail!, all to no avail. Still though, SiS did it the way it should be, no really bad words, and it was romantic, but to shove literal bathroom humor into a movie that wants to make history (like SiS did) or entertain us, or make one want to watch it over and over again. Keep it clean, use the proven track record of movies in the past that succeeded without having to resort to lowering its standards to appeal to today's internet types. Above all, NEVER, EVER have Rosie O. in any of your movies... :) (I had to say it)<br />Anyway, Slow Learners wasn't all bad, it had some definite funny parts, the two dorky nerds in the book club were the best, they had some genuine comedic lines that made me laugh out loud several times. There were also a few others in this that I liked and did a pretty good job with their parts.<br />Hopefully the two main stars in this movie will get better parts, or learn to act, or something, I don't hate their acting, only in this movie, and I am sure that there will be those that would like this and not see it the way I did, but that's is how I saw it... Maybe I'll see them in another movie and I'll eat my words, I really hope so.<br /><br />I would give this 2-1/2 stars though if I could, but I can't using  Amazon's rating system.ere is no need to say all of the stuff they said, especially that many times, and I promise, I say those words myself, but for me, in a romantic comedy they should not be raunchy.

1,"...it's not easy to follow. I appreciate the bleak characters-scape, dark tones that color the urban frames, collision of story lines, over the top shoot-outs, emotion-less world views and poignant moments of heart-breaking closeness, but it's a more of an emotional ramble than anything else. Gotta be in the mood, I guess."
0,Boring. Pointless.
1,"Great movie! Very interesting and dynamic storyline. Like many foreign films, it pushes your level of empathy and understanding and makes you ask yourself what you would do in very specific, emotionally charged situations. I highly recommend this movie."
1,family dynamics of the characters are complex and psychology interesting.
1,Good...not great
1,I like this show
1,"Good beginning, but ending very hard to believe."
1,My Granddaughter loves Shaun the Sheep
1,"I really loved this movie.  Brenda Blethyn is one of my favorites, especially in her series, Vera.  Hillary Swank is great, and should have received better recognition for her work,especially in the movie, The Homesman.<br /><br />Is it possible that this movie, Mary and Martha  received little attention because it deals with real life and really tough problems?The same could be said of the movie,  The Homesman.  It dealt with people's lives in truly difficult times and conditions.  Maybe we just fail to appreciate talent when it presents to us the gritty aspects of human existence.<br /><br />The story of Mary and Martha allows us a close insight to the grief of personal loss, suffered by each of these two remarkable women.  None of us enjoy sorrow, or tragic loss of a young person.  Stories such as this help us somehow to understand such loss apart from our own heartaches.<br /><br /> I am glad this story was based on a real Martha and her real son, Harry, who died of malaria while working with children in Africa.  I wish the Martha character had been given a more active part in the development of the story for television.  Time constraints have to be considered.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for all,especially women."
1,Awesome show!
1,Someone pay Larry David so he will do season 9!!
1,A Classic
1,Not a thriller. Tension is built. Confusion on the behalf of the authorities in the movie was an example of too many bosses with their own agendas who were unable to focus on the morality and ethics of conducting the interview. It is a stretch of the imagination to believe that one person could control people with  such psychobabble and cult craft. (Spoiler) Revenge is served up on a platter of martyrdom.
1,Wonderful black and white movie!
1,Excellent series!
1,Great movie my whole family loved it
1,Well done
1,"Great plot, interesting and deep characters. Fantastic writing and acting- can't say which is better. Overall excellent show"

0,Way smaller them the pictures show it.
1,Absolutely a TREAT! So creative and masterful.
0,Slow moving
1,I thought It was a great & charming film! :)
0,Started to watch it twice but found it slow.  Tried to keep with it but left never to return again.  Sorry.  Most of the Masterpiece stuff is interesting and keeps our attention.  This was a disappointment.
1,"Decent show, kinda slow, and speaking strictly as a male... the nudity is nice, not as &#34;bad&#34; as Game of Thrones but for a show titled Casanova... what do you expect? Diego Luna puts on a good performance for an (what could possibly be a good complete show) intriguing show."
1,Absolutely the best series
1,Yep
1,Pissed they cancelled the showâ€¦totally leave you hanging with what happens to Chester Mills folks!
1,"Was so faithful to watch all the shows but their were always some I missed.  Loving watching every single one again and picking up tidbits and clues I missed before! Gillian Anderson and David duchavney (sp?), grow more as actors and become deeper characters by season 3. Now I'm into season 4!"
1,Fantastic!
1,Love the show!
1,Great
0,"Boring, trite, poorly acted"
1,love it
1,LOVE this show!! Please post more Amazon!
1,Very suspenseful. The music is incredible and I love the timeless era that was portrayed.
1,"srsly the best show ever. Well, no Game of Thrones is; but very close second"
1,Insightful! Most Christians are totally unaware.
1,"A sci-fi classic and one of the most under appreciated movies of all time.  If you haven't seen it, please do yourself the favor."
1,Well written sci-fi!
1,Great family movie.
1,I Loved it.
1,Season 1 was very good. Season 2 was even better. The set is unbelievably realistic!
1,"Good spooky showâ€¦fairly formulaic but not so predictable as to be boringâ€¦you know what's coming, but instead of saying &#34;This is stupid&#34; and turning it off, you find yourself saying &#34;Don't do that, don't do that&#34;â€¦that, and creepy puppetsâ€¦ughhh"
1,Alway a great movie every time I watch it!
1,Love this movie!
1,"Simplistic and highly stylized animation, but an entertaining story.  Could actually have been a little longer to explain some of the back story of some of the key characters."
1,Awesome!
1,great
1,"This made me want to be a better person. I have often wondered what more I could do to be greater and achieve greatness. It was the words of jiggly puff that really got me. &#34;JIGGLYPUFFFFF!&#34; yes, that's what we all needed to hear."

1,Awesome
1,"Fantastic mini series. Loved it. Informative and entertaining. As a foreigner living in the US, I knew very little of the Roosevelts. Highly recommended."
1,"Fascinating and fast paced brilliantly written, directed, and acted. I'm a huge fan now."
1,"This is not a good series; it's a GREAT series!! Highly, highly recommend it."
1,"I can't find anything wrong with this entire program. The writing is excellent , the acting is outstanding. A great drama all the way through. My favorite season is the second, but you need to watch the first season to know the characters."
0,"I tried to give this 2 stars but failed. Bad acting, bad writing, bad special effects. Very little suspense. Just horrible. I've seen probably several hundred horror movies since I was a kid. It's hard for me to find a decent horror movie I haven't seen. I hadn't seen this one before today and now I know why."
1,Awesome series...
1,The kids loved this movie. They never lost interest and were engaged the whole time.
1,Starts a bit slow but I like the complexity of the characters and that nothing is wrapped up perfect with a bow. I'm only on episode 3 so we shall see!
1,Nothing to complain about.
1,Great Style.
1,It was very entertaining.
1,Great show
1,Great show

1,"Very fine show, interesting and gripping characters, well written. The music is at times inspired."
1,I forgot how funny it was. They don't make them like that anymore.
1,One of the best shows I have seen...or will ever see.
1,Great show. Funny and engaging. I just discovered it and sad it is not longer than 3 seasons.
1,Suspenseful pilot
1,This is a fantastic series....I'm so sorry I didn't watch it in real time and so disappointed the series had to end.  It was a snippet of I believe things are done in a newsroom with a personal touch added.  Brought up so real news that carries on even today.  Bring it back!!!
1,It's a masterpiece - to think this came so fully formed straight out of the gate is mind boggling. The casting is perfection - Bill Shatner is unbelievably good
0,"Quite possibly the worst move I've ever seen.  I couldn't fninish it.  No one acted...it seemed all actors where there only for a pay check.  And, they didn't work very hard for it....."
1,Beautiful set and costumes / tragic story
1,Good story
1,I have not finish it and it is great but there is one chapter that boring as hell.
1,I love the movie
1,CANNOT WAIT FOR SEASON 2!
0,"Can't really say much more, can I? Except to explain why I disliked it so much, but I don't want to waste more time on this p"
1,Great from start to finish!
1,"I wanted to like this show.  I know it has won some awards, but I just couldn't get in to it.  The actors say their lines as if they are on stage rather than realistically.  Who in real life talks like that?  They seem to be reciting clever, erudite  and very long speeches rather than speaking the way normal people do. Not my kind of show. I've worked in newspaper offices--news people don't talk like that."
1,"This is art. Beautifully made visuals, good old fashioned children's tale."
1,Love this show.  Love the truth in it.
1,Awesome
0,Yikes - much too manipulative for me.
1,Really enjoy it.
1,"Clean cute cartoons, no cussing, no whoring, no homos kissing each other or worse.<br />Just clean cartoon."
1,"Great escape movie, lots of action and  great ending"
1,"I thought it was quite good, but not quite up to where I would like to see it.  I bought the whoe season, so I'm going on faith that what seems like a slow start will soon develop into a great series."
0,Meh....I was expecting more from this movie. It was not good....
1,Informative movie of the hidden darker side.
1,A fun time filler. About the same as E #1 and better than E #2
1,Great movie
1,I can't get past the captain of the Enterprise playing Jack Ryan.
1,Movie kept an interest level above average
0,"I wasted my precious time watching this one,it sucked"
1,"My husband and I are in our 60's living in Texas, but still we thoroughly enjoy this series about a California high school girl who can't resist solving mysteries. She is certainly not Nancy Drew. She frequently breaks the law, makes bad decisions, and alienates other people. The show follows both her short-term and long-term investigations, and we usually watch several episodes at a time because we can't wait to see what is going to happen next."
1,Funny funny funny.
1,a touching film that can stir the emotions.
1,Enjoyed the action and characters. Might not have been the best of Viking movies but certainly was by far not the worst. Historically probably off a bit but well worth the time to watch.
1,Just like I do with most shows I came in late.  So I'm watching all I can on Prime.  I love it!  Can't wait to catch up on all of it!
1,Very interesting portrayal of the development of Atlantic City.
1,Such an amazing cast...plus the imagery is so thought provoking. Definitely a movie for the thinking man(and woman). Beautiful!!!
1,Enjoyable story. Great for family viewing.
1,This has been one of my favorite war movies for quite some time. I would highly recommend it!
1,Awesome!
1,Too much relationship garbage.
1,Very fun!
1,Great show
1,"Please, please, please give us more episodes. My kids enjoyed the pilot and that song is stuck in all our heads. It's a really cute concept based on a really good story. Hats off to Dallas Clayton."
1,A fun series about a transatlantic romance and accidental pregnancy. I like the idea that a couple can be good people who find love after being &#34;forced&#34; to be together.
1,Very good story well written and well told. Eliz. Banks is excellent.
1,"I enjoyed it, watched it mostly for Jeong-Min Hwang :)"
1,Very fine actors - very believable characters.
0,Very boring
1,One of the best movies I have seen
0,"I'm old, but it's boring. Maybe if updated I could &#34;sit&#34; through it."
1,"It's worth a watch, but a rental more likely being a better suit for it. Wasn't anything spectacular, but held interest with these newer characters in another other world story about the Justice League."
1,Eddie Marson is always interesting.  I enjoyed it
1,"Fast moving,with good plot and colorful costuming."
1,Great movie
1,"Intriguing well scripted mystery which keeps you thinking!  Slow, progressive development of charcters with social issues and contexts explored by the fine acting skills of all protagonists.  If you like British mysteries, this is a good one."
1,Better than the movie
1,Very complicated but worth every minute. Visually stunning. Stewart's best performance. Binoche's usual stellar roles. The actors really dug deep to play these characters!
1,For any Anglophile the Allyen mysteries are a must. For anyone else who loves period pieces of England enjoy!
1,This is a great show!
1,not bad
1,I Love this series. The characters are a collection of believable actors. Each show is entertaining and leaves me wanting to see the next episode.
1,"Romantic comedy. Kind of funny. Silly plot. Carol lu,bard is beautiful. I didn't know the costar. It was just so so."
1,Good stuff. I love it you will too.
1,Great series!
1,"In 1993 in Beatrice, Nebraska the high school put on a play called the gallows. An accident occurred on stage were Charlie was hung. Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler)  joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.<br /><br />The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films.  We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming. I liked it. The problem I had with the twist is that there is a &#34;discovery&#34; of things that happened 20 years ago, secrets I didn't think would exist in a small town where everybody knows everyone's business.<br /><br />Guide: 1 whispered F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,Love the show!
1,Interesting pilot. Good acting.
1,"Very interesting, enjoyable and educational!"
1,"It seemed that the show lagged a little at the start of the season, but finished well with Frazier in his quest for &#34;the one&#34;."
1,"I'm in after one episode, but I already have a theory.<br />So there's that.<br />And my profound disappointment that episode I was a teaser.<br /><br />But I dug it. it's a gritty, slice of southern, privileged life drama about a man who loses his kid and his mind at the same time. It's well cast, the dialog is real, and it's beautiful to look at."
1,Loved it!
1,Can't go wrong with Abbi and Ilana. LOVE THIS
1,"Great characters, timely stories, a little disturbing but very engaging. We love all of the main characters.<br /><br />We watched Season 2 on network (which just finished) but wanted to re-watch early episodes to see it full circle. The story moves fast and alot goes on, so it was well worth watching again!  P.S. The early episodes weren't on demand through our cable service so we were happy to watch on Amazon.  Thanks."
0,Stupid plot line.
1,Good movie that keeps you thinking.  It's all in the details with is movie.
1,This is a very well done documentary on a very interesting family.  Hope life goes well for them all.
1,Best of them
1,Fascinating story on a different side of the 9/11 attacks.
1,Great movie. Especially for a MFFL!!!!
1,Awesome
1,Great story!
1,Great series.  Couldn't stop watching it!
1,The second season seemed even better then the first season.
1,I  Love the show!  I can't wait for the next one!
1,"Aside from the terrible ending, this is a great season of a great show."
1,"It's okay.  Interesting as a classic - and there's also something to be said for comparing this to other versions of the story.  Not terrible...and watchable, too.  A favorite of mine, though?  No.  Not really."
1,I love Stargate
1,"I really enjoy the story, and character developing, photography etc. However, I'm kinda getting sick of the raunchy nature of the script, with strong mysogynistic in your face scenes. I think it dates this amazing story, and places it firmly in the age in which we live - which is unfortunate. It could have been a timeless story. Shame."
1,"Warning SPOILERS!! Acting was superb, as was the cinematography, enjoyed the father daughter interaction, thought their science was a little too convenient about the benevolent alien intelligence putting a teseract in a black hole to solve their issue with time distortion -- and the fight scene was just too much, too bad we were in another galaxy or we could have had a car chase or a gun fight, otherwise a great movie."
1,It builds up to the ending but then they rushed it. There was like ten minutes left when it seemed there should be another half an hour.
1,Fantastic so far!
1,Great movie
1,Great series
1,One of the best program for children in my opinion
0,"Because Creative Galaxy and Tumble Leaf have been moderately good, I thought we'd give Wishenpoof a try even though I was already turned off by the image of a waif-ish thin girl with the teensiest button nose.  It's a shame that we can't do for girl characters what we do for boys - just make them engaging, likable and confidently solving problems and exploring and interacting with the world.  Instead girlhood is depicted like its a problem to be overcome with some belief in yourself and effort.  This is NOT a helpful message but comes off as an assumption that all girls need some sort of remediation from being girls. When the character of Bianca breaks into a ballad within each episode it would be nice if her singing voice actually sounded like a child's and not a grown woman's. Again, confusing and invalidating to young girls."
1,I read the book. and it had alot more details. I was so glad that alot of the details were left out. Because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to  watch it.  The movie got the point across  without going through all the sickening  detail that those  woman endured.
1,One of my favorite shows!
1,Great series!
1,SHOWTIME!!!!!!!ðŸ˜‹
1,Entertaining if watched from the first episode.
1,Great show hopefully waiting for season 2
1,Great show
1,Awesome
1,"By the time I finished viewing Season 1, I was thoroughly enthralled with these families.  I love anything about British culture and as much as I love Downton Abbey its nice to view a series about present day Brits.  The episodes are very well written and I'm always disappointed when its over.  An hour flies by!  I would highly recommend this series."
1,I was so impressed with the work done with all of these dogs.  I watched it after hearing an interview with the trainer of the lead dog(s).  Very hard to watch at times and what a horrible situation but quite an education.
1,need more shows like this
0,"Season 1 started out a bit weird and slow but by the end of Season 1 you were hooked and Season 2 didn't disappoint with its intrigue .  Season 3 just goes off the weirdness deep end. The plot/storyline is full of holes and dead ends.  The characters have become less believable and the show is re-using themes and have been overused in the sci-fi realm.  The whole thing feels like a cut-rate &#34;B&#34; movie.  You sure don't get the feeling that there are &#34;thousands&#34; in Chester's Mill as is stated several times in episodes in this season. The season suffers from continuity errors -- a cut shirt in one scene is fully repaired in another occurring within minutes of each other.  For having a 6 inch metal rod shoved through her thigh and almost bleeding to death, Julia has made an amazing recovery, running through the forest without a hitch. I would vote that the dome just contract to a singularity and put us all out of our misery."
1,Good fun
1,Everything about this show is MAGIC!  Love it!  I was sorry to see it end.
1,"All I can say is WOW!!! This series is really causing me problems because I don't want to turn it off and go to bed.<br />Truly phenomenal writing, and acting."
1,"I'm not usually a Martin Sheen fan, but this movie touched me....could have left out the American bashing!"
1,We enjoyed the conclusion of this tale of family and the dysfunction thereof.
1,Nice show work the look see.
1,Good entertainment and educational
1,Really enjoyed kept watching to see what would happen next.
1,Fascinatingly stupid!!
1,"I thought this would be more riveting, but it was a lot of dialogue in a bet din amd nothing much else was happening. It does provoke the thought of injustice and misogyny that exists."
1,geat movie
1,You must pay attention.  Very good.  Not for those who buy a six pack pat the kind on the rear and watch the NFL.
1,A dark interesting movie. Nice twist.
1,Awesome!!
1,We cannot stop singing ðŸŽ¶Falafel waffelðŸŽ¶<br />Cute show
1,OK
1,Fantastic! Inspirational!
1,"Love Teen Mom 2. I have been watching teen mom 2 since it first aired. Very satisfying and entertaining. I can't get enough of this show, amazing impactful stories. Love them all, and I don't want it to end. I want teen mom to continue so that I may see the children become teenagers.<br />Best purchase ever, I highly recommend it, very addictive show."
1,"Very weird this season. Not sure how they can account for the kids getting older every year, when it has only been 3 weeks."
1,"different than 'typical' movies - makes you think about the purpose of our lives and karma... yeah, karma.  can be a real bitch.  :)"
1,Very interesting.
1,Super cute movie!
1,Enjoyed the twisting
1,Touches your heart.
1,Enjotable movie
0,Ending this dry dull movie after 1/2 hour. Yawn
1,Loved this - I've watched it many times - and appreciate the top acting and the story itself!  Baldwin/Streep - great together!
1,"Maybe TOO much science for those of us not into astrophysics.... but a GREAT movie for Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, et al.<br />If you are looking just for entertainment w/o thinking hard, stay with Star Wars. Too much science that cannot be unseen by the human<br />eye, but proven by mathmatical formulae.<br />The CGI people had to come up with graphic designs of astrophysics that only exist in theory.<br />In the end, this movie works hard to expand your mind if you read &#34;Archie&#34; comics instead of &#34;Fantastic Four&#34;.....or failed to take at least one year of celestial mechanics at an accredited university."
0,"Boring, repetitive and monotonous.  While strongly feminist in its message, it is still only of interest to an Orthodox Israeli audience.  For the director to ask viewers to watch the entire movie, regardless of well it may mirror actual life; regardless of it's conclusion, is ask far too much."
0,Bad
1,This was a great movie for our six year old granddaughter and her grandparents enjoyed it too!
0,"Raunchy, and not family-friendly.  Disappointed"
1,Loved it.
1,If you can ignore some of the violence it is a great tale.
1,Absolutely love this show!
1,Tom Cruise was too short and too pretty for the role. Can you imagine him playing Travis McGee ?? No? Me either.
1,It kept me interested.
1,Awesome. So sad to hear HBO cancelled season 4!
1,This series a fast paced and intelligent!
1,good movie especially if you are already a Adam Corolla fan. Contains much of his comedy bits from his standup and podcasts.
0,Really a waste of time
1,It's ok except for the gratuitous sex scenes. Aren't you tiered of that?
1,Love this show
0,"This would have been an excellent show, except for the nudity and sexual situations.  If I wanted to watch porn I would order it.  I don't want it in my shows."
1,"It was a good movie but little bit disturbing, I was disappointed from the Main actress."
1,great movie!
1,"This is a well-written, well-acted series."
1,Fun
1,Things start to come full circle for Tony and his family.
1,The actors are great and the story gets more interesting every time I watch.
1,It's good
1,Very entertaining movie!
0,Way too much foul language!
1,This sit-com we have always watched and enjoyed a lot because of their life and enjoy of each member of the cast.
1,It was a real twist. Watch it spin your head.
1,"I love Bubble Guppies. My one year old granddaughter likes to watch it, and will dance to the music. I like that it is educational in a fun way. Also, I appreciate that there is nothing controversial or political hidden in the show. It is very simple and fun."
1,It's a nice beautiful movie...
0,Worthless
1,"Fast paced, edgy, funny!  Great show!"
1,"Clean, real, heart warming, profound."
1,Great suspense and if you like SciFi related to extraterrestrial life this is for you!!!
1,ymjsrmrymrymry
1,needed more life to it
1,far fetched but worth the ride!  great actors.  fun romance movie. chick flick... in a good way!
1,We enjoyed this movie. Scenery was beautiful. I want to my bike to France now.
1,My 5 year old granddaughter loves this and she likes to watch it at night just before bedtime.
1,"A love story movie with Audrey Hepburn is so much the better...her innocents, her beauty...magnifique!"
0,Hard to follow.
0,I have to apologize but my granddaughter and I both feel asleep on the movie.  There was way too much going on in this movie.  I think we just found it overwhelming with all the game players.  So sorry.
1,loved the novel and so far i am not dissapointed.
1,"One of the strangest documentaries I've ever watched.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, though.  It is too bad that it's still an unsolved case."
0,Didn't like that
1,Better than Season 1
1,Richard Norton is awesome!
1,I think that it was pretty good.
1,Good movie
1,Great show should have went longer in TV
1,I like that they can solve problems intelligently.
1,This quickly became my favorite show of the season. I loved the characters and the story line. I'm just sorry there weren't more episodes and that I have to wait until the next season to find out what happens with the baby!!
1,This is my 9 year olds new favorite show
1,How can you not love this movie? Great classic.
1,"Such a funny, we'll written show. Love Louie!"
0,"Loved the first 2 seasons, this one fell short...really short! I am continuing to watch it but this season got really &#34;campy&#34; and predictable."
1,Story line was meh.
1,Great story line.
1,"Have watched 4 episodes of 1st season. 21st century western. Pretty light fare overall - not heavy and riveting like Breaking Bad or The Wire (both of which are 5-star programs in my view). But the characters are interesting enough, at least so far, that I'll continue watching."
1,Great family movie.
1,A great message.
1,"Interesting, could be a good one."
1,Very cool show
1,well done
1,"The teams are quite balanced. From season 5, now contestants cannot do more than 6 roadblocks. Earlier the stronger person of the team did all the roadblock. This new twist adds more challenge. Pretty good selection of candidates"
1,Love this series
1,Great series.
1,This was very good story ... but I thought the main character &#34;Worricker&#34; was a little too stiff.
1,This was an outstanding movie for me. I like the old British stories with big old mansions and generations of scandalâ€‹. Maggie Smith does a great job as the grandmother with the last of the family history and secrets. Magical!
1,Thought provoking
1,I think this is an interesting series and like the second season even more than the first.
0,This movie was okay but it wasn't the greatest.
1,suspensful
1,Great
1,Best series I have ever watched. I will be so sad when it's all over.
1,lots of action and intertainig.
1,Great mini series....have watched and enjoyed several times.
1,Great
1,It was o.k.
1,One of the best comedies ever.

1,Off beat...not what I expected. evokes emotions across the spectrum. Well played!
1,great show
1,Not just an update of the original. Very well done 5stars
1,"Love this film. Every day I feel that we are on the brink of Idiocracy!! If you are a fan of Mike Judge, you will love this movie. Others who are not fans or have not heard of Mike Judge, this movie style is similar to Best In Show. Funny. Engaging. Disbelief. Accurate. Enjoy!!"
1,Suspenseful but with hope.
1,This will be an awesome addition to Kirkman's universe.
1,"This was one of the best movies I've seen in years. I've never watched a movie more than once, this I plan on watching again. It's not just a war movie, it's about the person who Chris was.  Very moving."
1,Good
1,"I love this series.  I am not a Shakespeare expert, but am familiar with many of his plays through college classes, theater, and movies.  I find the information presented in these shows extremely interesting - whether it be the historical context of the work or the interviews with current actors on how they gain inspiration for their characters.  You can watch these over and over to focus on elements you may have not explored in depth the previous time.  Watching these will inspire you to re-read a play or go to the theater to experience it live."
1,Educational and kids enjoy watching it!
1,Love them all
1,Loved it!
0,don't waste your time.
1,Jeff Bridges is at his best!  Soundtrack is awesome!  Have watched this movie three times already.

1,"Great family movie. Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman, you can't go wrong."
1,I have seen a lot on the subject and thought this was good.
1,Timeless classic
1,Love this show
1,Kids & adults at our house love Shaun the Sheep! So funny!
1,I have really enjoyed this program.
0,We're usually Brosnan fans but this was not his best performance and is on the edge of pornographic. Sorry we paid to watch...most of it. Finally had enough and turned it off.
1,Seems interesting. We will be looking forward to the first season
0,It's a stupid childish weird movie the bunny was glitchy looking
1,This was probably the best war film we've seen that really takes you there to understand what these veterans have been through. Excellent acting and storyline.
1,"Ken, we get it....apartheid baseball besmirched the game."
0,Not as great as everyone made it out to be. Predictable.
1,I like the religious occult thing going on during the depression years when people were more superstitious and miracles more obtainable.
1,Solid movie...a good one to rent for sure!
1,I sure miss the family shows. Watching this was refreshing and I plan to watch every season! Played without any issues.
1,Love these drama movies!! :-)
1,"I love Curious George.  After watching it , I feel happy and carefree.<br />This show leaves you with a good feeling and leaves you feeling very happy!!!! Love it!! ðŸ˜Š"
1,fun and semi-sophisticated<br /><br />Look forward to next batch of shows
1,Love it
0,"It was simply terrible. Boring, poorly scripted drivel, terribly pathetic performance by EVERYONE, crappy cinematography and sound. The most lackluster independent film I have seen to date."
1,This movie will make you think about your relationships. All of my family enjoyed this movie.
1,"Good movie but did have points that were a bit slow, loved the cast and thought the acting was great and realistic in this film"
1,"I like Dwayne Johnson! Not your classic Greek mythology movie. They should do a Conan movie with Dwayne as Conan. And yes, I enjoyed this movie."
1,Rewatching Stargate again....because it's the best show ever!
1,"Good movie, if you are in a mood for a disaster flick. It's just fun."
1,Absolutely great (and totally unexpected).
1,We are going to watch all seasons on Amazon.
1,Inlove with this show and watching on here was Anazebals as I live in Nigeria
1,I was pleasantly surprised with the acting. Very good series.
1,"Wonderful movie, definitely a multi-view"
1,Great show!  Love it.
1,Not that bad of a movie.
1,just a good show
1,"I was leary of this spinoff but after the first episode I'm in! Too early to tell for sure but the acting, score & production all seem better to me and our family has watched every episode of TWD twice! The young addict seems to be a rising star as he portrayed hus role to a T. There are some couch critics out there blasting this show but if your into TWD you will like the start to this new series!"
1,"funny, fast-paced, clever, well-written"
1,Good stuff
1,I have always admired Corrie Ten Boom.<br />Excellent Story
1,It was good
1,"Slow paced, some parts were funny. Worth watching once"
1,Interesting start to a new series.
1,for some reason I love this show. can be fun and serious. my family enjoys my quips throughout each episode
0,Was slow but ended ok.
1,Keeps you engaged the whole time!
1,Really enjoying this series
0,It was okay.  The first and last episodes were the best.  It's worth watching if you don't have anything else to watch.
1,Truly a different kind of show--very creative.
1,Charming
1,Awesome of course!!!
1,I've only watched the first episode but the transition into the 2nd season was well done.
1,So funny and great music
1,"Would really like to see where this story could go from here.<br />Could be the next Breaking Bad and not just because Walter White, alias Heisenberg/Bryan Cranston was in it<br />but without the blue crack."
0,It was not a good movie.  Kind of ridiculous.
1,"This was a sweet quiet movie. I really grew to Iike the oddball characters, and it all came together in the end."
1,"just like a television ironman broadcast, but without commercials."
1,"Great movie,full of suspense loved it"
1,Excellent and peaked my interest along the way
1,"A &#34;B&#34; sci fy with rather good acting but a weak plot of solar flares threatening earth.  For a better similar movie, see &#34;Deep Impact&#34; or &#34;Armageddon.&#34;"
1,Meke sure you have tissues handy
1,How they make more shows I loved it.
1,love it
1,"Enjoyed this movie, but then, I am a sucker for period films."
1,One of the best TV shows ever. Should be ranked among the best in anyone's list.
1,Good. Characters have evolved a bit for both good and bad
0,Just lame
1,Great family movie.
1,Great scary  movie. They don't make them like that anymore.
1,"Not what I had expected, but nice."
1,"I ordered this and then discovered it was free on You Tube. Don't waste your money on an otherwise free movie. It was very good, but I didn't realize it was the same as the one that was free till I purchased it."
1,"AMAZING!<br />This movie makes people realize that &#34;good enough&#34; is not what you were made for.... It applies to any relationship, not only fatherhood..."
0,"I like my movies about gods, magic, and legend to actually bother to work those elements into the story.  Mr. Johnson should be ashamed for lending himself to this terrible waste of time.  I felt as if I'd been tricked by his name being attached to the project; I won't be again."
1,Mary Jane's tremendous
1,Needs more romanse
1,An intriguing setup with surprisingly well drawn characters and an exquisite period aesthetic. I hope this gets picked up.
1,"I was amazed at how much I like the series.  The cast of characters is superb.  Costumes are wonderful.  It takes you through history, beginning with the sinking of the Titanic.  When I first started watching the series, I didn't think I would like it.  After the first couple of scenes, I was hooked!  We highly recommend that you watch this one."
0,"The movie contained only 3 or 4 scenes of decent dialogue, the rest of the time the movie is being heavy handed with what feels like religious propaganda. It goes so far as making the science minded Loomis(Ejiofor) seem like a bumbling idiot. Ann played by Robbie acts as if she's a 12 year old girl trapped in an adult woman's body, yet Caleb(Pine) and Loomis say &#34;she acts a lot older for her age.&#34; Also, there wasn't a single person named Zachariah in the movie. 1/10"
1,Enjoyed this movie.
1,Three
1,so how do we see more?
0,Crude and juvenile. A desperately pathetic attempt at humor that might appeal to an extraordinarily poorly raised adolescent. I couldn't take more than about ten minutes of this trash.
1,I am enjoying this series but it does not compare to ER or Chicago Hope but it's still good.  I like the characters and the situations seem realistic. It also makes organ donation a less scary proposition.
1,Amazing.
1,Very good British mystery addition.  Characters are fresh and realistic.  Have become addicted to it after only the second episode.
1,I wish there were additional seasons
1,Strong start.... Now it's just getting weird. Third season is disappointing.
1,love PBS documenteries
1,Great show
1,Interesting series.
1,Amazing season on the edge of my seat every episode! !
1,"Simply put, this is my favorite movie of all time. Period."
1,IntInteresting premise.  I am waiting for the whole season.
1,"Great show , great characters"
1,Pretty good movie! I enjoyed it and am interested in reading the book now.
1,Wish they had more episodes than just 6 of them but it was excellent!
1,I love this show.  I wish there were more like it.  The stories are great and the acting is the best!
1,Daughter enjoyed it
1,"Critics aside, a very enjoyable movie.  If you are a fan of the series than I cannot see you not liking the movie."
1,My daughter and I love watching this show together. We're hoping for a season 4!!!
1,I enjoyed it. Funny. Lots of cursing.
1,I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

1,"My daughters favorite! She loves dance and this movie was perfect for her. As much as I like American girl movies, I kind of wish everything didn't always end up so perfect. Not realistic for girls watching it."
1,My daughter can't wait for season 2
1,Great series.
1,Superb acting.  Well done.  HBO Films are always high quality.  Recommend for anyone and everyone.

1,"short, informative, and nice breasts."
1,Great.
1,Decent
1,Much better than Season 1 & I enjoyed Seasin 1 as well.
1,Good movie
1,"I actually didn't watch the last 15 minutes or so because the guy is actually really creepy. Gives the impression that he's hiding small children in his basement. But still, it's interesting commentary of people's willingness to blindly accept what is perceived to be of high value. And I'm left baffled by the guy obsessively hunting him down."
1,Hysterical!
1,Great Movie. Nicole Kidman looks good for her age. lol
1,ok
1,Good action movie with some nice twists.

1,He's a great actor. The scenery was gorgeous. A few interesting scenes. The two child actors were brilliant. But the story was lacking.Glad I waited and didn't pay to see in the theater.
1,Great!
1,Love the music. Would have given it 5 stars but deducted for foul language and moments of bad acting.
0,Terrible movie wished I had not of spent my money on this.
0,bad acting
1,Well worth watching not just about Israeli military culture but for view of paternalistic societies and what any person within institutional structure faces in questioning &#34;the means justifies the ends mentality&#34; until it eventually corrupts the very ideals on which it founded itself.
1,Thoroughly enjoyed it...pj
1,Great way to watch a love story develop
0,"As much as I love the character Matthew Gray Gubler plays on Criminal Minds, I can't help but wonder what the heck he was thinking when he decided to do this, terrible movie.  The movie is definitely low budget and I expected to see some decent acting from the cast or even some good humor from the story writing.  I got nothing.  I forced myself to watch the whole thing to spite the bad story and the bad cinematics.  I do not recommend this movie.  It's a good wast of over an hour of your life."
1,"Great addition to the franchise.  Tom Hardy is masterful, even though he doesn't say a lot.  Charlize Theron shines as a mysterious woman revolting against a dystopic world.  The action builds on and surpasses previous Mad Max offerings.  This is a worthy successor to the series and the plot twists keep it interesting.  Lives up to the hype."
1,Daughter loves Dora
1,Very good story with educated people and no killing or hard decision scenes. Perfect for a couple  it is interesting from a masculine as well as s feminine point of view. Rare in today's movies<br />Highly reccomebd

1,My kiddos (ages 2 & 4) LOVE Shaun!
1,"As good as the series was, season one was the best."
1,Very good movie about a horrific battle during WWI and it's aftermath on two countries and two families. Terrific acting. It's was hard to know who to feel more sorry for given the tremendous toll on both sides. Just another example of the untold cost of war.
1,"As always, Ron Perlman is exquisite, and a wonderful cast as well as plotline.... nice twists and turns. ."
1,"Ranks right behind West Wing as my all-time fave. Timely, well-constructed storyline, and well selected cast."
1,it was very immersive watching on a computer screen but i found the horror to be a bit lacking
1,Good show!
1,"The show is so good that I paid the extra $$ for it. I never pay additional for TV shows. Rectify is very poetic in script, cinematography, and acting. The subject matter is intelligent. Everything about it is amazing."
1,Love this movie!!!
1,Very interesting story line
1,Good movie
1,"This is a great show, can't wait to see what happens next!"

1,Very educational for kids.
1,Very good documentary on the sad state of emergency medical care in South Africa.
1,Just can't stop watching!
1,"Eh, it was OK. DiCaprio played the very neurotic Hughes very well, but I could not stomach Cate Blanchett as Hepburn! AWFUL! Worth seeing when it's free and you don't have anything else available to watch."
1,Great show
1,"Originally watched as a fan of Jimmy Pardo (the host), but it really is fun, entertaining game show that keeps me coming back for more."
0,Kind of stupid.

0,"Watched it for free using Amazon video credits, and I still regretted it. Terrible movie."
1,"are you kidding me?  this guy is a saint.  do yourself a favor, watch it"
1,My boys love it! Quick episodes.
1,"An excellent series of films that focus on the fighter planes and their pilots, from all sides of World War II."
1,"First two episodes felt like a pretty good rom com movie. Fresh, witty, British, a lot of critique on social formalities. Third episode dropped off quickly into boredom with noticeable gaps in the character development. I don't think this will have legs as a series unless there's a lot of character shakeup. Even that, I don't see how this will have continued success."
1,The movie was okay.Waited for it to get better but it didn't.<br />'
1,"Fun, but too similar to prior two bttf movies."
1,Good WW2 story. People who try to understand the nasty Nazi mentality will shake their heads again.
1,"Had to see my buddy Greg Buckley in this - of course, it's great because he is possible The Most Interesting Person On Earth.  I highly recommend it!"
0,This was rated G but had so much evil it was ridiculous!
1,Gotta love the British sense of humor
1,Very funny and cleverly written. My husband and I laughed out loud at the characters and situations. Being an American and UK married couple we enjoyed the cultural differences immensely.  Hilarious!
1,Very informative and well done.
1,Super funny!!
1,Great show
1,Good series
0,pure bull crap.
1,My children and I love this movie! It has a genuine old school vibe with all the music they played at the skating rink when I was younger. All the actors played their roles well. In my opinion this was an excellent family &#34;feel good&#34; movie!
1,Great stories and art...fun for the entire family. Episode &#34;The Grey ghost&#34; is a stand out.
1,"Not one of Terry Gilliam's best films, but still better than a lot of films. It was missing that really crazy Gilliam edge that most his films have."
1,One of my favorite shows because I love the characters. They are all fun to watch and of course Stiles is one of the best.
1,"Rating this four stars because I enjoyed the actors very much.  For some reason, I thought this would be lighter fare, but it was a bit depressing.  Sweet movie, nevertheless.  You can hardly go wrong with Robert DeNiro"
0,"Very difficult to follow. Season 1 was good, season 2 was okay, but season 3 is just out there and I have discontinued watching it."
1,Success comes with a price of giving of oneself for humanity's sake in God's image for His glory!
1,Excellent drama
1,really a good show.  how did i miss it on tv?
1,My girls LOVE this show :) ages 5 1/2 and 7 1/2
1,"In 1993 in Beatrice, Nebraska the high school put on a play called the gallows. An accident occurred on stage were Charlie was hung. Twenty years later that same high school is putting on that same play because it can. Football player Reese (Reese Mishler)  joins the drama club and plays a speaking role next to drama queen Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) on whom he is crushing. Ryan (Ryan Shoos) films the whole thing and Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) provides some addition cleavage.<br /><br />The problem is Reese can't act so they decide to sabotage the stage so the play will be cancelled and Reese won't embarrass himself. A stage that is supposedly haunted.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same thing as all hand held camera films.  We have dark cam, the hall whispering cam, the what is that cam, the foot cam, the green cam, and the green foot cam. All this makes for a bad film. The twist at the end, I admit I didn't see coming. I liked it. The problem I had with the twist is that there is a &#34;discovery&#34; of things that happened 20 years ago, secrets I didn't think would exist in a small town where everybody knows everyone's business.<br /><br />Guide: 1 whispered F-bomb. No sex or nudity."

1,Transparent is the coming out story of a professor. A real eye-opening series for persons seeking to understand the world of someone battling gender issues.
0,"Wow, the acting was so stiff in this production.  I've seen high school plays with more passion.  I came across this completely by trial and error in looking for the Inger Nillson versions of Pippi Longstocking."

1,kids loved it
1,Amazing show!
1,Pretty well done.
1,"My 3 year olds favorite TV show BY FAR!<br />I have seen each episode at least 20 times, and it is not annoying for parents."
1,Sad documentary and should never have been allowed to happen.
1,"This is an okay series.  It gets better as you go.  No sex or off color language.  The story is good, some episodes are not as good as others."
1,good.
1,"Exceptionally strong cast, decently good Sci-fi story line.  The characters are multi-dimensional - not always good, not always bad.  Overall a great show."
1,Really enjoyed this 3 part series. Also enjoyed the interviews with the cast and writers.
1,So glad I decided to give this series a try!
1,Follows the book pretty well. Great writing. Special effects are splendid.
1,He is the best. What a great comedian.
1,Excellent
1,Excellent
1,"Overall a fun movie - fairly high production values and a fantastic cast that is, unfortunately, kind of wasted on a script that seems underdeveloped (to put it kindly).  Jeff Bridges' accent sounds like he'd had some really unfortunate dental work and/or had a potato stuck in his throat, but there honestly wasn't a whole lot of nuance to be lost - so that was fine."
1,Good premise. Great potential.
1,GREAT SHOW!!!!
1,loved it--want more!
1,Hilarious adult comedy.
1,Very funny movie

1,Love this show
1,AAAA+++++
1,"When I heard Connelly's detective was going to be featured in a television show, I was skeptical. There was no need. This show is so well done, I can't reccommend it enough. Welliver is perfect as Harry, and the writing is top notch. I am so glad there will be another season."
1,It's ok.
1,A fun urban fantasy.  Sit back and enjoy
1,loved it!
1,"It's a slow burn, and character driven. There are a couple of real bullets fired, but most of the violence is implied, and that's all you need. I fully understand all of the commentary about its slow pacing, and in terms of plot, that's mostly true. In terms of character, it's chock full. Flawless performances from all involved, and truly riveting, if you're paying attention to the right details."
1,My husband really enjoyed this season.
1,"awesome but, where are the rest of the episodes ? 0:"
1,I wish that I had more stars to give - be sure to watch the 2 seasons in order
1,Hilarious show!
1,Pretty cool that she can pull off the many parts
1,Great show for preschoolers!
1,Not the best but enjoyable.
1,"unusual and engaging, smartly written and well acted - and thankfully no laugh track!"
1,Most awesome show ever!
0,I did not grow up watching Superman so the origin story is new to me. I just appreciate Chris Nolan and was looking for a good story. I did not find that here. The narrative is loose and undisciplined. I only watched the first half of the film before I gave up.
1,I love Madea
1,I didn't want it to end. I couldn't wait to know what was gonna happen next.
1,"Wanted to like this more than I did...I was unable to finish it...I just found myself pausing, and pausing..until I finally just lost interest in finishing it and turned it off."
1,Good but expensive
1,Best Show ever made. I'll watch this show loads more.
1,"My daughter loves this show and even though the title song is VERY catchy, each episode is an educational experience."
1,One of the best series ever!
1,"Stands the test of time.  Funny, smart and memorable.  Toshiro and Akira at their best.  And the great supporting cast too.  (Can't forget Tatsuya :)"
1,My 3 year old daughter loves it
1,Best show ever
1,Great series. Can hardly wait for Season 7
1,i just loved this.
1,"Beautiful story continues with that added bit of humor.  Yes, of course it is a historical soap opera, but so well done it terms of period pieces, scenery and wonderful actors.  I'm looking forward to Season 6, but sad that it will be the final one."
1,Funny!!
1,"Gritty, realistic, and often times disturbing. No matter how awful some of the prisoners are you still find yourself rooting for them."
1,The absolute BEST. Love the storyline and the actors are brilliant. Just wish I didn't watch all of the episodes in one sitting. Can't wait for October 2016!
1,very good intense drama blew me away.
1,Fun film. Beautifully filmed
1,So clever and fun.  Perfect for every kid and the kid in you.
1,I'm hooked on it. But there are some sketchy plot twists throughout. Gonna see it through!
1,Great movie to refresh the soul
1,I watch several episodes every night..It is a great series!
1,Great movie
1,"The information about this woman was presented in a slightly different manner that I found illuminating and...well... it's a strange word for this dreadful topic, but 'entertaining' as well.  I remember reading about this woman as I did my research for the book I wrote on Belle Gunness.  There were two other ladies in London doing this, too...and way too many orphanages in the U.S. allowing children to die, either of disease or starvation.  We think of the Victorian/Edwardian age as a time of high morals by the middle class. We're very wrong."
1,hilarious campy sci-fi
1,I guess it was a good movie
1,Great fun to watch and it's family friendly too!! win win!
1,never hear of this about  in war time england
1,Movie was ok.  Had a couple of laughs.
1,What our men and women go through is unimaginable! What they see day to day is truly horrifying! They are called the best of the best because they are! I pray for the soldiers we have lost and their family's. I pray every soldier that comes home will fight evening harder to get help and be well....this you all deserve! From this small corner in Alabama...I say again THANK YOU!!!
1,Great show!
1,Good mind thinker.  Lots of twists and turns.  Keeps you evolved.

1,My new favorite show!!!
1,Stunning twists in plot and exquisite character development.
1,"This is for the full 2 Seasons of The Last Ship.  Season 1 had a slow start and then it found its groove around Episode 5.  I was hooked.  I was also hoping that they would renewed it for a 2nd Season and they did!  Season 2 is a roller coaster ride and it definitely keeps you at the edge of your seat.  As much as I want to watch the last episode, I also will miss not having a great Sci-Fi to watch.  I'm thrilled to have read that The Last Ship has been renewed for Season 3!!!"
0,REALLY B-grade.
1,excellent!
1,A very refreshing and funny and well acted movie
1,"I really kept an open mind on this television show. While everyone was disappointed with the Pilot, I felt it was right where it needed to be. The Pilot shows the build up of characters and it shows the outer surroundings of what is expected during an epidemic. This is a completely different setting with too much going on. That is how life really is and realistic patterns during a crisis. People must not remember much about the Pilot to Walking Dead. The first episode was spent watching Rick walk around and figure out why he's so isolated. Where is everyone?  It was centered on him. In addition, we had no idea how it happened. We just knew there were Zombies.  While the audience is aware of there being zombies in this show, the characters aren't certain what exactly this &#34;virus&#34; is and what it does. The writers can't really go full blazing with zombies. That wouldn't set up the story right into seeing how things develop slowly. I'm certain this show will  take the spotlight in due time. I'm excited to see the last episode of this season. You can only go up from here.  They need this to carry on this show for all the Walking Dead viewers. If anyone has read the comics, everyone knows how the book will end and what the outcome can possibly be."
1,Enjoyed watching
1,it was worth a watch.
1,A great look into the mind of a chef and the day to day operations of a restaurant and the relationships developed through working with local purveyors.
1,can't wait for season 2
1,"FINALLY!  I love Jason Mewes AND I love goats! LOL  If YOU love goats, you'll truly identify with the main character,...and maybe even MORE if you're a country girl like me.  You need to watch this movie. Seriously. BOB is not silent in this film, but Jay is."

1,A lot of ideas and info on individuals interacting in a diverse society.
1,It was a cool concept but it felt super slow. It could have been so much better.
1,"great series, like it very much!"
1,"Witty, well written and sometimes a little cheese thrown in.  I have completely fallen in love with HankMed and would highly recommend this series."
1,Have to view shows in sequence or lose premise of content. Sometimes a little slow to develop storyline. Like the show. T Welliver is good character actor
1,My family found it eye opening.
1,Pretty good.
1,I love this movie
1,Excellent. Sorry season 7 is not out. We are hooked on the series
1,"Best movie , don't miss it."
1,Seriously funny. My roommates and I always get a kick out of watching awkward. Maybe because we are young adult girls who experienced similar situations when we were in high school!
1,Best British period piece in years; hope they have a season 6!
1,My 20 month old great granddaughter loves the Bubble Guppies...every time she sees a kindle she says Guppies...it is so cute.
1,It actually was an entertaining film.
1,Very funny movie.
1,Very good subject matter
1,Best TV show on TV!!!
1,Gripping. It's easy to become invested in the characters and their various subplots. This is the closest I've come to finding a show that's as entertaining and engaging as a good book.
1,Absolutely hilarious. New favorite show.
0,"The story line is good.  The men are hot.  The acting, however is NOT...."
1,Interesting!
1,This show is great for children 8-13.It will teach your children a lot of fun.
1,Awesome show
1,"I think this movie did keep your attention,a lot of action, i would recommend it!!!"
1,"Absolutely one of the best (if not the best) new show. Funny and ironic, woven around an expertly written story. Several small salutes to the movie, but the story is fresh. Although there are no real surprises, you can't help but want to watch to see what happens. Like with Game of Thrones, don't get too attached to any of the characters as you never know who will be bumped off in the blink of an eye. Can hardly wait till season 2 starts next month."
0,Eh.
1,One of my favorites
0,"It appeared to have a good story, but the profanity just overcame any of that and I had to stop wasting anymore time enduring it.  bummer!"
1,We thought this show was pretty funny! It is a somewhat unbelievable premise to start but if you can get past that the writing is pretty good.
0,"While this story had some interesting twists, turns, and misdirection, much of it was just plain creepy.  Perhaps that's what the director was going for, but I found it to be somewhat cringe-inducing.  To me, a more clever choice in this vein is &#34;Assassination of a High School President.&#34;  Avoid &#34;The Good Student&#34; and get on with your life."
1,Pure awesomeness!!
1,"Very good movie,"
1,Great story line. Great ensemble cast. Lots of production value.<br /><br />What more do you need to rate five stars?
1,Good watch
1,very entertaining! !
1,Classic....I laughed my okolie off
1,great for grand kids
1,"Love, Love, LOVE JAX!!!"
1,"Characters generally seem believable and likable. Not a good choice for those offended by profanity, sexual references, etc. (little of which I found to be gratuitous in this case, and made the characters and dialogue more believable)."
1,"It was worth watching. Beautiful scenery, soundtrack was nice in that it was there and beautiful music, but only accompanied the story. She found her natural talent despite the boys club. I liked it. I would watch it again sometime."
1,"My husband, sons and I absolutely love this series on innovative science projects that solve societal/technological problems!  These 3-5 minute films give just enough information to introduce the viewer to the problem & solution, and they leave the viewer wanting to learn more about science.  Our favorite film is titled &#34;Meet Mr. Toilet.&#34;  Mr. Jack Sims presents the serious problem, lack of access to toilets, in such a humorous but informative manner.  Another great film is &#34;The Secret of Trees.&#34;  We are amazed how a 13-year old invented a way to harness solar energy by aligning solar panels in the same pattern as leaves on trees.  The leaves follow the  Fibonacci Sequence, a recurring mathematical formula in nature.  Yet another is &#34;You don't know Jack.&#34;  This film showcases the research by another teenager who is fervently working on developing a cure for pancreatic cancer.  We need more programming like this to inspire youth to pursue creativity in science.  We can't wait to watch Season 2!"
0,"We loved the first movie, but couldn't even finish this one. Wish I hadn't spent the money!"
1,Little one enjoys it. Cute songs
1,Great movie for kids and adults

1,Fast movie good car scenes.
1,Great salute to the franchise and a tribute to Gene Rodenberey.<br />Lot of campus by the original stars lending their voices.<br />Rent this nostalgic trip down memory lane.
1,"Nice family story, but the sound quality made captions essential for understanding the dialogue."
1,Very funny look forward to viewing more of this
1,"I was apprehensive about the Sobotkain plot; however, it worked out well in the end.<br />It was a very good season."
1,This a really great show...the show just cracks me up.
1,"One of the most fasinating films I have seen. Leaves lots of questions unanswered, and wanting more. The human spirit of survival is amazing in this documentary of true life story of a family kept locked up and hidden away from the world. What emerges are the most creative, talented, inciteful, resourceful, deep thinking individuals I have ever seen. Makes you really wonder how life could have been for them had things been different. Definitely a must see, especially if you feel sorry for your self for some reason, at not being given what you think the world owes you."
0,"I grew up loving the turtles, so it's hard for me to untangle my reaction to this movie as a movie from my childhood love for the property.  But even when I do my level best to be unbiased, this is a bad, bad movie.  The CGI was so over the top it was distracting. The constant forced references to the original property never felt natural or organic, flowing from the action.  Instead, each was a jarring reminder that &#34;hey look, we're part of a long-running franchise&#34;.  Megan Fox's acting was cringe-worthy at best, the action sequences felt like a video-game, the dialog was atrocious, etc.<br /><br />I know I'm really not the target audience for this, my 10 year old kid who'd never been exposed to the turtles before loved the film, and it made a boatload of money, but we watched this &#34;for free&#34; on Prime and I definitely feel that I overpaid.  Sorry kids, this film sucks"
1,Kate Winslet shows us once again why she can counted on for a stellar performance.  She is backed by a terrific award winning cast that you would expect from a major Hollywood production.  HBO knows how to do it.  Keep 'em coming.
0,I hated the book and was hoping to the movie was going to be better.  But I really only wanted to see it because it was filled at Bandon Dunes.  I couldn't get through 30 minutes of it.
1,It was pretty decent as far as big foot movies go. I may have given it four star if it didnt end cheesy.
1,Loved it
1,Nice movie.  Entertaining.
1,A classic!
1,"Great movie, liked the dinos."
1,I enjoyed this movie even though it was quite predictable.  Characters were interesting.
1,Love this movie! I'm an adult and I grew up with Disney movies so of course I was over the moon happy when I heard about this movie! I immediately made sure I would record it the night it premiered. And it was amazing I enjoyed the characters. Especially Mal.....ok I take that back I love them all I can't say I have an actually favorite person. Anyways this is totally worth the ten bucks! Defiantly watch it!
1,I enjoy watching this show very much!
1,This movie is a timeless classic!
1,"Not being a classical music fan, I was initially a little put off by the premise. I should not have worried, a truly excellent show. Funny, touching and actually has got me listening to some classical music. Great characters."
0,Boring.  Had potential but overall very boring.  The only good parts were shown in the preview.
1,My all time favorite and i cannot express how much like the whole series in 24. I saw all episodes almost 4 times but willing to see even more and more. Best series in my life. Thank you Kiefer Sutherland.
1,Very different - really liked it.
1,Very good character build and unpredictable ends to scenes.
1,"Really gritty and well written show.  The story lines are really believable and engaging.  It was hard to see Titus in this role for me at first, because I was used to him as an Iris mobster in Sons of Anarchy ... but her totally owns this part.  Great show.  Watch it."
1,Watch it!
1,Great acting by some favorites.
1,If you are a fan of Judd Apatow then you will love this movie. There is a bunch of low-brow humor but it is not enough to prevent you from enjoying the clever concept of the film and the naively-saavy character that Steve Carell plays. Definitely caught myself laughing out loud more than once. Especially during the drunk-driving scene where he becomes an unwitting passenger.
1,Great family movie with a happy ending!
1,My 3 year old son loves it and that's good enough for me!!! Just as good as the first Elmo musical!
1,"Great show, can't wait for more."
1,Absolute classic!
1,5 Star
1,"Definitely one of my favorite seasons. It's exciting, full of colorful characters, and has a very positive outcome at the end which I think viewers will enjoy witnessing."
1,Pretty much like a hallmark movie.. Predictable
1,a step down from the first series
1,"O. Henry's famous short story, The Gift of the Magi, was well done."
1,Love this show!!!
0,Some off-color and not so funny jokes spoiled the series for me.  Enjoyed the idea but the content was a little too R for my taste.  Too raunchy.  Maybe I'm a prude but I think some things are better kept private.
1,Good movie
0,"I thought this was going to be funny ! It was NOT !  Shaquille made a mistake because of the foul language, misogynist and sexist comments about women. If this is what you would share with adult friends that is your pejorative. Very disappointed with  talented comedians who would want to be  known for insulting women."
1,Good series. Last episode was overly predictable and a little lackluster. Some credibility risks throughout. I don't feel cheated though. Amazon delivery was excellent.
1,Love this series and will watch more
1,Enjoyed it.

1,A terrific movie.
1,good acting-great story lines- and feel good family values portrayed...
1,"Incredibly relevant show, well acted, and mesmerizing. For me, it started out slow, but once I got into it, I couldn't stop watching."
1,Why haven't you watch all episodes already?
1,"Great writers, actors, directors, and just the right mix of professional and personal storylines.  And then there's the best setting for these stories, New York, New York..."
0,"Still funny but not as good as the first one.<br />Some new stunt/ jokes but with less imagination, too many of the same old stunts/ jokes.<br />Definitely not worth a 3rd movie."
1,Review
0,"Very slow start, rather boring till the end.  The &#34;artistic&#34; style just feels cheap"
1,Love it!!! Pretty intense.....
1,There are so many interesting stories from WW2 and this is another one.  I would call this a reenactment/documentary type of movie.  It was interesting to hear the story straight from the mouth of the guy who endured it.  What a brave man he was.
1,"Really enjoying, forgot how nasty Alexis was!"
1,"It was OK  a little slow moving,  but a nice story."
1,Wonderful show!
0,What a fun romp!
1,best series on prime.Have to suspend my reality that it is just a show. Gives new meaning to what is happening for real in Chicago and Baltimore itself
1,Fun
1,Good!
1,Good show great story line.
1,very entertaining
0,Didn't finish watching episode one. Seemed silly.
1,"Good, but not as good as TWD's pilot."
1,It's the Soprano' fagidaboudit!
0,"Let me start by saying I'm a fan of Hader and Wiig, and I wanted to like this movie because of them. But ultimately it doesn't deserve these positive reviews. Its not nearly as deep as it claims to be, and really the entire plot is a long-winded whine. The acting is quite good throughout, especially Bill Hader. However the storytelling is so contrived. Its as if whomever made this movie first sat down with the title in mind, came up with an entire movie based on the title, and never really went further than adding obvious symbolism. At the end I could only think, &#34;Does this story really need to be told?&#34; It's the kind of plot you'd find from that boring co worker who complains about every facet of his dull life. Maybe it's just me but I can't watch a movie where something bad happens to the lead and then they mope about for the next 70 minutes."
0,The movie struggled to be funny. I felt like I was watching non-comedic actresses trying too hard to be comedians.
1,Really enjoyed this. Smart writing and great acting.
1,Lame compared to previous Alien movies. The idea of the story of telling the origins of the aliens is really good but poorly told. A missed opportunity to make an epic and original Aliens movie.
1,This was funny and cute.  It's something you can watch if your kids are running in and out of the room.
1,"I was a huge fan of this show!!! It seems a long wait to get them available to purchase and I was happy to buy season 5. However, season 4 does NOT give you the option to purchase the entire season!!!!<br />WHAT GIVES AMAZON?!!!!"
1,Can't stop watching
1,Great first episode hope it continues.
1,Thank god for prime in the sumer
1,my kid loves sponge bob
1,"Good, but seemed somewhat low budget."
1,Excellent drama series
1,I can't wait for season 2!!!!!
1,"Great movie, easy to watch more than once"
1,good story
1,Cute
1,"My 5 year old girl loves it. I'm thankful for the positive messages that she really relates to. It isn't one of those shows that I can watch with her, but they don't all have to be."
1,Good one
1,Not only is it a cute show but it teaches kids at the same time
0,Amazon streaming is NOT Netflix.  It freezes up all the time and Amazon customer service offers no help other than telling me that my tv is not compatible with their services that I pay for.  Justified would get 5 stars but this is the only platform that I can offer my opinion about their streaming service.
1,A classic - what else is there to say?
0,The violence was uncalled for
1,"While very violnt, a great acting job, with humour as well.  Loved it:)"
1,"Grew up with this movie , seen it a dozen times and it is still great"
0,There's some action here.  And there's a plot.  Sort of.
1,"great series, waiting for season 5 free to Amazon prime"
1,Nice cartoon
1,Compelling characters and excellent acting.
1,"Really fun show, just wish it would leave out his sex life. Seriously un needed"
1,A bit rough in the language department but a very funny and romantic picture of a joyfully created  but unplanned pregnancy and its follow through by the participants.
1,"A very clever, entertaining and thought-provoking series, and season 4 is one of the best seasons. An amazing cast, with the group of the middle school pupils very convincing."
1,Wish there was more but nooooo ) :
1,Awesome
1,"â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘A GOOD MESSAGEâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘<br /><br />This movie came out of a time in Hollywood where the fashionable thing to do was to cram as many stars into a movie as possible, each with relatively small parts and no real leading actor. Then they would sell the movie to audiences based on the star appeal rather than the content of the film. Most of this genre stunk something awful. (I'm looking at you, New Year's Eve) But Love Actually really delivers. It's an anomaly.<br /><br />It is still a bunch of actors crammed into small roles with a loosely connected story line.<br /><br />But the theme of each mini story is the same, that love is strong and takes on many different forms. You can love your wife, love your best friend, love your family, love a girlfriend, love someone you cant' have, love someone you can have, love your kids, love your country, etc etc etc. Some love is easy and fun (The Prime Minister and his girlfriend) some love is hard (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's marriage) and some love is down right painful (Laura Linney caring for a mentally ill brother).<br /><br />Each story comes back to that theme in the end, that no matter what else is going on in life and no matter how bad the world seems, there is love all around us. It's everywhere, and it's not hard to find. All you have to do is open your eyes to look for it.<br /><br />However, count me on the side of people who think that Andrew Lincoln's character was WAY out of line to go to Keira Nightly's house shortly after she's married to Lincoln's best friend to profess his undying love for her. That's not sweet. That's not cool, man. That's some low down home wrecking stuff there. People are split 50/50 on this scene. Some people think it's really sweet. But the truth is that he's unburdening his soul at the risk of damaging his best friend's marriage. That's not good. That's selfish."
1,Great
1,"Great story that everyone should know. While it felt a little long in places, we really enjoyed it."
1,The series had gotten much better by Season 5. To bad season 6 and 7 require you pay to view them.
1,Good as usual
1,Our 7 year old Granddaughter loved it.
1,Blue's Clues is one of our favorite learning programs! :)
1,Fair
1,Excellent.  Learned things I forgot or never knew about Presidents
1,Laugh out loud funny.  Love the characters.  Great new series and looking forward to Season 2.
1,Awesome movie. I shed a few tears.
1,I enjoy this show.
1,"The plot was a little odd, but I liked the characters in the movie so I didn't mind watching it.  If these actors are not some favorites of yours you may not like it."
0,"Is it a documentary or is it fictional? I couldn't tell, and I wasn't involved enough to care."
0,"With most of the dialogue garbled by accents, the interest in the story is difficult to follow. Do not really try to make much of this one, there is not much there to begin with. I really cannot recommend this one."
1,my family love this.
0,Horrible. Even for me who has a high tolerance for bad films
1,Great drama.  You have to ignore its hard liberal take on the news.
1,"In PETTY ROMANCE director Kim Jung-hoon takes a standard romantic pairing of potential lovers to establish the oddly compelling parameters of success in the adult comic trade.  Jeong Bae (Lee Sun-kyun) is a struggling artist in the manga (called &#34;manhwa&#34; in Korea) world of sex and violence comic books. He learns of a contest with a first prize of $100,000 USD. The only problem is that Jeong Bae needs a script writer to complement his artistic skills. He interviews various candidates, all of whom do not exactly fit into his scheme of a hero who can combine manga type sex and violence into a winning formula.  Enter Han Da-rim (Choi Kang-hee) whose own sleazy background is acceptably graphic. The romance of the film begins with the inevitable bickering between her vision of a hero and his. She sees Jeong Bae as one who is locked into a losing image of commercial manga art whereas he sees her as too graphic (if one can be so in manga) to work with. Much of PETTY ROMANCE is replete with manga style animation with a stylized female assassin fetchingly clad as she slices and dices her way through legions of hapless victims.  There is little doubt however that this bickering will by the closing credits lead to a satisfying climax of personal and professional success. There is nothing petty about PETTY ROMANCE. The leads bounce off each other in ways that seem somehow real despite the unreality of their linking professions.  One can sense that PETTY ROMANCE is a fine example of a Hollywood style romance of the 1930s that is just as entertaining today in Korea as Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn were in their heyday."
1,one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. whish it wasn't over in 5
1,Great series to watch.
1,A chilling reminder of what happens when an evil man gains absolute control of a country. Everyone should view this to better understand how he came to power in Germany and clues to how Americans must be vigilant in protecting our liberty from individuals in government who can usurp power without limit.
1,This series almost makes it.  Too bad its not quite there
1,One of the best police dramas on tv.  Consistently good story lines throughout the series.  I was sorry to see it end.
1,This is a great show and one that my wife watch together.
1,"hello,<br />  the connelly stories are always very good.  this one had rumors about being a tv series.  it should have been as the characters were outstanding and the plot was tremendous.  it is always fun to see the actual characters in books come to life.  plots and subplots make this movie exciting.  bring on more connelly movies...  a great movie and story..."
1,Yes
1,Excellent
0,"I don't like the styling of this documentary, but I do love the message."
1,Good action movie with some humor.  I enjoyed it.
1,"Great Show, Can't wait for next season!!!"
1,"This is a movie I am always eager to share with friends. Wonderful acting, a great story and a powerful message."
1,Very different!
1,Worth watching over and over again
1,"Enjoyed the show while they were under the dome.  Got weird after.  Show makes one think about the potential chaos of any emergency situation - shortages (fuel, medicine, food, etc.), people's behaviors (community vs self preservation)."
1,Wonderful story for kids. Great music.
1,refreshing
1,Pretty good so far....
1,wonderful casting
1,We love it.
1,Love Downton Abbey!  cant wait until the next season is on Amazon!!
1,best movie
1,Wow things changed drastically in the fifth season.  Just couldn't get enough of it!  Sad to see it end but I guess you can't keep it going forever.
1,"This is the cutest movie, a good story, a moral, a glimpse into rural life, just charming. The mouse chorus ... darling."
1,"Daniel Radcliffe was very good in this movie and it was a complete departure from his Harry Potter days. He's really proving to be quite the dramatic actor. Michael C. Hall plays charismatic creepy very well and I enjoyed this story. I had no idea the particulars of the story when I watched it, other than it was about real life poets and authors. Lucien was a brilliant sociopath and whoever played him did a marvelous job as well. It's not an action packed movie, despite being about a murder, but it's cerebral and an interesting glimpse into the lives of these iconic people."
1,Enjoyed it
0,Disappointing
0,It was hard to follow and it didn't keep my interest
1,So we'll done that we ended up watching<br />two go three episodes a nite.
1,FUN MOVIE TO WATCH
1,"Introspective look into why comedians become.... Well, comedians. Pollock was able to get some amazing talent to open up as to why they are the way they are."
1,I love this movie. I've watched it several times in August. It's witty and upbeat. It's not at all sappy like most romantic comedies. This movie is about so much more. I liked the characters and the story. I am thinking of buying the DVD.
1,Loved it! Please make another season:)
1,its awesome!
1,It was great! Really enjoyed it.
0,Very poor effort.
1,"EARLY PLOT SPOILER<br /><br />The best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34;  Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?"
1,"Great season, gets better in every episode"
1,Great!! Really liked it!
1,Loved it
1,"WHile I like the premise  of this series, Catastrophe, and thought it would be funny, I found this show to be tiresome and none of the characters likeable.  I usually make my judgements about TV shows early on in the series that way if I am not connecting with it I havent got a lot invested.  I havent given up on it completely so I may go back but for now I am going to pass.  By the way, the acting and writing are very good, just not exactly my cup of tea."
1,Best show I watched when I was a kid
1,"Brilliantly crafted detective series! Endeavor is a period piece set in Oxford, England in the mid sixties. There is great attention to detail! Initially the program's seemed complicated but all parts were cleverly drawn to a logical conclusion by the end of each program."
1,My hands down favorite show of all time!!!
1,It's okay.
1,Great...shocking
1,Ho Hum. Plot is far-fetched and actors were not believable.
1,Kinda funny and a little scary.  The plot was crazy ridiculous but still just fun.
1,It was good.  A lot of action.
1,Fun but serious. Different.
1,Really really good
1,okay
1,Great movie with influences from other greats in the children's genre. The makers of Secret of Kells have improved upon their last work to make a modern day classic. 10/10 would own and watch again
1,1
1,Well written and performed noir.
1,Love this show. But if you haven't seen the previous seasons you will be a little lost!
1,"I really felt for the main character.  Steve Carell was spot on with his &#34;acting&#34; which I'm pretty sure is just his personality because he's pretty much just a variation of the same person in every role I've seen him play and it works perfectly for this role.  However, the raunchy scenes were just way too much for me.  I should have expected it especially with the unrated cut but the only reason I watched this version is because I get it free with Amazon Prime.  If there was a censored cut I think I would have enjoyed that version a lot more."
0,I didn't like it at all!  Her comedy is disrespectful and not funny.
1,"I am a shelter volunteer. Although a bit on the reality TV side,  the series accurately depicts the ongoing struggle to find great homes at overpopulated shelters. It never ceases to amaze me what people throw away and how many should never have had the animal in the first place. We are guardians,  not owners. Big difference."
1,"Lots of comedy.  Overall, great movie! !"
1,Really good show interesting storyline. Highly recommended for watching a series.
1,Good
1,"This movie was just so so and I had a hard time staying awake through it.  I am a complete Si Fi nut, so most science fiction keeps me interested and this really did not.  I don't recommend it too highly."
1,Excellent!
1,Such rich stories
1,Spongebob Rules!
1,I thaugth it was a compelling drama  get me going .the in the finally was ok.  Would love to see her continue with the CIA
1,Great movie. I dare you not to shed tears at the end.
1,"Sex and more sex, and multitudes of other-species fantasies. More wikkens, weres, vamps, faeryes--oh yeah--than you can imagine, and it's all in one series. Plots as thin as soup, but you know if you've got a sci-fi bug, you're going to get hooked. Gu-ud technical effects. I've watched every single episode."
1,Good casting and stories.  Very entertaining.
1,"Excellent show, worth watching, great insight with humor on how cable news is put together."
1,Pretaaaay Pretaaaay Pretaaaay Good.
1,Great suspense...
1,"I love watching movies that have a great message, great story (in this case I believe based on a true life story) minus the sex and violence."
1,Cute for kids.
1,"Would also watch this , but not as good as sneaky PETE and Mad Dogs"
1,"Fantastic show.  Encourages kids to engage in arts and crafts and it addresses common issues (making mistakes, dealing with frustration) that young children face and offers &#34;artistic&#34; solutions.  My kids have already done three different projects based on the episodes."
0,"The original was great, this was a poor attempt to modernize a great story.  The shaky camera shot and addition of foul language was a totally lame attempt to make this movie more &#34;edgy.&#34;  Denzel Washington and John Travolta are good actors that were given a lousy script.  I would advise watching the original and passing on this version."
1,"I'd give it 3 and 1/2 if this system would let me. It's funny and cute, but not amazing."
1,This was such a sweet movie.
0,This was a great idea that was &#34;Hollywood-ized&#34; into a movie when it would have been better as a documentary. The storyline was obvious and you could tell what was coming.  The filmmakers placed more emphasis on the characterizations of the people and their relationships then the facts and the grittiness of what became a monumentally successful art form shrouded by falsehoods.
1,Kids & husband love this movie!
1,Very enlightening!
0,"Watched Part 1 and Part 2 and had to see it through to the bitter end. Absolutely the worst of the three, which is saying a lot considering how bad the first two were. If you're looking to see Rob Morrow in the role of Hank Rearden, forget it. He may have phoned in his 5-second voice-over and a stand-in could have been used for his fleeting appearance at the end. Worst DagnyTaggart of the three, as well."
1,Great twist !
1,Great series. Well cast and outstanding story line.
1,What am awesome show. It is so intense and keeps you wanting more. Love love love this show!
1,"My granddaughter said, &#34;It's really good and makes your dreams come true!&#34;"
1,"Suits has been able to maintain my interest since the beginning, which is rare for me. The characters are interesting and dynamic and the &#34;look&#34; wonderful, can't wait for five."
1,The series got better every year... they were at the top of their game in season 5.
1,The portrayal and dialog about making &#34;man made people&#34; is interesting. There are the usual good guys versus bad guys and romantic twists to help flesh out the ideas behind AI.  Could go deeper though. Excellent production.
1,Love it!!
1,Can't wait til the next one!! :D :D :D :D
1,Loved it!
1,Great!
1,very cute show. Fun to watch.
0,"Actors are good....general storyline okay. Language ridiculously offensive, tiresome and unnecessary. I could barely watch and even my husband thought...Geeze Louis, enough already. Justified so much better in so many ways. My point is, WHY? Did the language really add to story?  C'mon."
1,Lots of bad guys.  Smallpox epidemic in a town where no one is pocmarked! Timothy Oliphant is a sympathetic good guy and does his usual best.  Don't see where this going but it has kept my interest.
1,a bit strange but good
1,All W.Miller is good skiing and entertaining. !
1,Great writing and acting in all the shows and seasons
1,Funny. Clever story line. Interesting twists and turns. Jane is a wonderful character.
1,&#60;3
1,The outcome is obvious the process to get there is very entertaining.  Two first class actors.
1,Awesome Sci Fi movie - sure to be a classic!  The twist and turns are outstanding.  The science fiction is more believable than not.  A.I. is coming.
1,This is a so--so movie that is yet another version of the original Hercules with Steve Reeves. In my opinion nothing comes close to the original but the Rock does a decent job with the role and makes the movie watchable.
1,"Great movie but sometimes it's all in the ending and this ending left me wanting a little more, and in not in the good kind of way."
1,Great movie!
1,"I have lived this movie ever since it came out when I was a kid.  It never fails to pick me up, and under all the screwball humor is some pretty darned good philosophy."
1,A nice movie.
1,Awesomeness
1,"My husband is hearing impaired. These shows would be more enjoyable if the shows had captions. And for me so I would not have to pause the show to tell him what he missed, when the characters mumble or etc. he has difficulty with certain pitch sounds.  Please see if this can be fixed."
1,"I usually watch low budget straight-to-video pieces with an understanding that the acting will be pretty awful to the point that it distracts from whether the story is good or not. However, I have to admit that I am very pleased with this viewing. The acting was good, the plot was good and realistic--for a zombie-esque piece. I actually felt for the title character (Zoe Carden). I'm pleased that I made this selection and would recommend it to others."
1,Awesome
1,Love the show!!!
1,"My son thought crafts were &#34;for girls.&#34; Thank you for this show, he now has a new appreciation for crafts!!"
1,Great action packed movie
1,Absolutely loved this movie.  Combination of some serious war issues with the heart warming story about a boy.  Wish I could find more movies like this.  What a pleasant surprise as I had not heard of it before!
1,Loved it!!!
1,I love this show. I wish it was longer. LOL
1,Pretty cute
1,Great movie!
1,Quirky and funny. Certainly see the Seinfeld theme throughout.
0,the movie is subtitled.  I would not have purchased this if I had know that it was in a foreign language.  I wish it would have been listed on the Amazon description.
1,Pretty good though the bachelor party wasn't really needed...other than shock factor for the scene of fiancÃ© walking in (probably kinda the point).
1,Daniel Craig is a great 007.
0,I had to cancel it cause of technical problems.
1,"This series is totally silly and a little bit sexist, but the teenage girl in me certainly enjoys it."
1,"Hitchcock does amazing additions to the suspense through lighting and camera angles - don't watch it colorized, it looses impact."
1,Informative and very entertaining
0,Terrible.  Worst movie ever with the most ridiculous acting.  I would like that 90 minutes of my life back.
1,"What a great show! At first, once I got hooked, I couldn't figure out why. But after a while I realized that a major reason is the dialogue. The writers have a flair for language, and the actors deliver their lines with panache. One remarkable thing about the show is the amazingly fresh turns of phrasing by the main characters, especially the character of Boyd Crowder, one of the most likeable sociopaths you'll ever see. He's also highly educated and so smart that he's probably a genius. But no less a genius is Raylan Givens, the solid lawman and US Marshal. I also love the characters of the Kentucky backwoods like Dicky and his mom, Lady Bennett, and also the loveable goofy criminal, Dewie Crow.Try this show, and see if you don't get hooked, too. Poetry, drama, violence ... what more could one want in a show?"
1,"This movie was so awesome!! Definitely don't rent, If your a Fast and Furious fanatic...BUY! I did 2 days ago and will never regret it!!!"
1,Julia Roberts was so young.  The part was perfect for her.  She is not listed as the star actor but she does steal the limelight with her acting.  Supporting cast was wonderful.  Have seen this movie many times over the years.  Does not disappoint.
1,This was so good that I stayed up and watched all episodes in one night!  Loved seeing the Downton Abbey actors in totally different roles.
0,"Not worthwhile.  Main character pedantic, totally without merit - perhaps overplayed, but did not even get through 30 minutes.  Ugh.  Elizabeth Moss character entirely underplayed."
1,Very well presented. The interviewees were superb. An inspiring film.
1,Pretty good flick
1,Loved it
1,Maybe the best movie series ever!
1,"Slow start, but it picked up. I went in not having expectations but nonetheless a very intriguing series."
1,absolutely enjoyed it even though I had watched it once before
1,"Great show , all the characters are very well written and acted, I really wish they would bring it back"
1,Waiting to see where the season goes.
1,"Excellent film!  Great story of 4 men trying 4 very different avenues to make it in today's world.  Each trying to be Set Free of their own oppression and strife.  Marcus D. Spencer did a fantastic job in writing, directing and acting and commanded a wonderful performance from his actors.  Think Boys in the Hood meets Friday. :)  It will make you laugh, cry and scream at the screen.  I definitely recommend this movie to anyone and already have shared it with family!"
1,This is just a great movie!
1,Love this show!!
1,Excellent
1,I really like this show so many stories wrapped up into one and they all work great together
1,The first episode is so cute but they changed Bianca's voice for the rest of the episodes and I can't get past it!
1,awesome
1,Love
1,My daughter love this show! They cover a pretty good mix of skills that help kids learn.
1,I have enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot though I would like more science fiction and less love mess.
1,A classic!
1,Love this move. The ending is a tear jerker
1,My kids love it
1,On point!
1,Starts slow but just wait... it gets much better. :)
0,NO T&A
1,I will always love this show. Huge part of my teenage years! So glad Amazon has it!
1,I agree 100% with this documentary.
1,"I have enjoyed watching these.  Although some of the episodes are not overly involved, I enjoy knowing the history of the characters.  Good series.  Will be completing them all through Amazon Prime Video"
0,Ok
1,I liked it. I'm not a reader of the novels so I have no bias about the actor or the character.<br />Personally I like Titus Welliver anyway.<br />I look forward to watching the series.
1,It's a bit silly
1,It was absolutely amazing now if only it didn't buffer so much
1,It is exciting and unpredictable.  When the episode ends we are left wanting more!
1,Love the cast.  Entertaining action movie.  Do not recommend for younger family members.
1,"If that's really how divorce works in israel, that's a sad fact.  It was depressing but interesting."
0,"I am a huge Bollywood fan.  Some good actors in this one, but unfortunately I would not recommend this film.  I didn't smile, laugh or cry through the entire movie, and I found myself looking forward to it being over."
1,It was really good - great time waster
1,"The Best One Yet!  I am an Amazon Prime member and the download and sound quality of the Instant video on Amazon Fire TV was great!  I remember seeing a comment about poor download sound quality, but I purchased the HD extended version and it was perfect, both in picture quality and in sound!  Order with confidence."
1,Love the show
1,cant wait for more.. it is gonna be crazy!! stay tuned
0,not really that enjoyable
1,The concept and the idea is thrilling but the first episode is not. When I first read about it I wanted to see it but then it couldn't keep me glued till the end
1,I enjoyed it very much. It kept me guessing and so held my interest. I am looking forward to season 3.
1,Funny!
1,Second time I've seen it was just.as good.
1,"enjoyed the first season, great characters, good dialogue."
1,"My granddaughters (4 & 6) absolutely love this show. It is also funny for adults, as it has adult humor that goes right over their heads but makes me laugh out loud."
1,Interesting stories about how some lives evolve and lead to incarceration.
1,Such a difficult way of life and yet these people only know difficult. And they seem to appreciate each day not knowing what tomorrow will bring. Very enlightening! Another way of life
1,Great fun to watch.
1,Season 1-4 has been absolutely amazing...the casting and acting is superb...by far the best comedy series of the 21st century (also including The Office)
1,The storyline is played out and getting to be boring.
1,Can't get enough Elmore Leonard? Then you will enjoy this series
0,Really not my kind of movie
1,Excellent script!
1,Great show..
0,Absurd show!
1,"This started out strong with lots of promise for quality storytelling.  Unfortunately it deteriorated, as it seemed to condone lying and badmouthing people.  I was disappointed since I had originally thought these characters would be worth caring about."
1,"Great story, nothing like the book, however."
1,"its definitely not oscar material, but it was not intended for awards, so for entertainment, it's perfect, and MJ is actually good at cartoon movies ..."
1,very cool
1,"The greatest &#34;horror&#34; show on television, with still the cunning and psychological elegance of The Silence of the Lambs (maybe even more so since the writers had more time to fully developed each character). Season 3 has been my favorite so far. The noir style is beautiful, specifically with the costuming (Dr. Bloom and Bedelia's especially). I thought no one could potray Hannibal like Hopkins did...until I watched Mikkelson resurrect the character with profound respect for the source material. The highlight of season 3 l, though, has to be Gillian Anderson as Bedelia. Never have I been so enamored and perplexed with a character than I am with her. She truly believes that she has found moral high ground, all the while participating in her &#34;husband's&#34; carnage with no apologies or remorse. You would think she's just doing what she has to to survive, but her behavior once she leaves Florence proves that she has the same monster inside her that Hannibal does, she has just learned to tame the beast, making her all the more dangerous. Great show. So sorry it was canceled. Here's hoping Netflix picks it up."
1,loved it great movie for all ages.
1,This was a very informative film and I know view drug advertisements and drug salesmen in a new light and it's not a good one!  This does not shed a favorable light on doctors as they are to quick to prescribe drugs and now I know why.  Everyone should watch this movie.
1,"Entertaining.  Some cheese scenes but overall a good movie.  Keira is beautiful, as always."
1,Loved it!!!!!
1,Love the show
1,Good movie
1,"great movie  , lots of fun and laughter always love it."
1,A little dated and the plot jumped around but a good story nonetheless. I retired from the Army so anything that tells that story interests me.
1,One of my old favorites !!!!  Really enjoyed this!
1,A good movie about dealing with grief.
1,Excellent choice for family movie night!  Vin Diesel is hilarious as an impromptu babysitter...
1,Great Show! Very addictive!
1,Make this into a full show
1,My hero.
1,Helen Mirren does not make a bad picture!
1,"These guys are crazy. I love their talents and skills, but this is a little too much like Jackass for me."
1,Great show.
1,Very well done
1,Enjoyed every minute if it!
1,Over all I enjoyed it....not bad at all!
1,Love this show
1,My wife and I watched this movie with our grandchildren; great story and very enjoyable.  Highly Recommended!
1,Not many people understand the cerebral humor Frasier delivers.  Classic!
1,Very cute.
1,Great!
1,Outstanding movie!
1,Cannot wait for Season 6
1,Would watch again
0,"This film showed promise at the beginning. However, toward the middle it devolves into a massacre of blood and gore that was pointless.  Really disappointing.  Colin Firth is such a great actor and deserved a better script and plot!"
1,Great movie in which did the book pretty good justice!
1,A very nice series
1,I love this show!!
1,I love the action and love story! This show is just fun to watch! I can't wait for the next season to be on prime so I can watch it!
1,Fantastic movie!
1,Well written and well acted. A show ahead of reality tv.
1,"It could have been 5 stars, but the series was canceled without resolving open issues.  Naturally I didn't know about the show when it was on the air.  :("
0,I was really disappointed in this movie. All the hype over the car chase and the mustang. It was nothing like todays movies and chase scenes of course but it was a very slow movie.  0 stars.
1,"This is a five star movie due to the excellent  people selected for the characters. I really have known people just like the ones portrayed in this movie, great insight also to the people and culture of India. Put this on your must see list."
1,"Fun horror.  The best kind, in that you are scared but feel okay because of the laughter and the whole not taking demonic forces too seriously.  I think the end could have had more of a punch than just the gotcha,  because of the most horrible part of the film....The catacombs...were underuitilized. But still,  the film is a lot of fun and Dark Vision 2, The Darker Vision, will be even more fun!"
1,Good show! Interesting but NOT dark and violent .
1,Love all shows but one
1,great movie
1,"I don't miss Brody or his annoying family. At. All. Now it's about Carrie's strength all of its own, not hinging on her attachment to an elusive man. Fantastic season. Sorry I have to wait to watch season 5!"
1,"Very good story of US Servicemen, their abilities and sacrifices for future generations of people the world over."
1,Loved this film. Jessica Lange is stellar
1,Good show great story line.
1,"Love it Love it Love it. Not to deep, but entertaining enough to hold my interest. Have not missed an episode."
0,"Listing indicates you can download the purchase, but fails to mention that the ability is limited to a few select devices, and definitely not to the laptop or cell phone. I felt tricked, and will never make another similar purchase."
1,Love this series ... hope to see more episodes soon.
1,Excellant / more language than I like
0,This video was really really boring and more akin to the lame history videos shown in school back in the day.
1,I expected a little more action. It was a pretty good psychological thriller. Cool setting and good cinematography.
1,One of the finest TV series the WB produced. Too bad it ended when WB and Paramount merged.
1,Great movie one of my favorites.
1,It's helped me quite a bit.
0,"I liked the first movie, Divergent. I thought it was a unique concept. The sequel, which is Insurgent, was not as good. It was mostly comprised of fight scenes and shooting scenes. Not a lot of great dialogue, or story or character development."
1,Always heard The Wire was excellent.  Now I know why.
1,Great flick! Perfectly clear.
1,I enjoyed Season 1.  It appears to be close to reality and I did enjoy that.
1,It's a classic.  My kids and I enjoyed it.
1,Excellent show for young children. Keeps their attention for a long time.
1,excellent series
1,Refreshingly original adult oriented animation.
1,I think it was scarier when I first watched this as a 7 y/o but still good horror movie
1,Some of the best television I have ever seen
1,Entertaining
1,Love it.
1,Great stories. Perfect casting and a wonderful group both at the police station and at home. That includes the CIA Spook father.
1,"Rusty (Ed Helms) is grown and an airline pilot for a small airway. When the neighbors are over for dinner, he sees an enormous amount of father-son bonding, that he become envious and realizes his family is in a rut. He decides a vacation to Wally World (and not Paris) is what the family needs and announces to the audience &#34;The new vacation will stand on its own.&#34;<br /><br />His family is a bit dysfunctional.  We discover his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) was known as &#34;Debbie do anything&#34; in college. As a side note, I don't believe there is a Memphis State University, but the University of Memphis is a dry campus. Kevin (Steele Stebbins) the younger son swears excessively, wrestles, and likes to bully his older brother James. James (Skyler Gisondo) who &#34;doesn't have a vag.., but it would be okay if he did&#34;, keeps a wish diary.<br /><br />The film was funny. The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.<br /><br />Guide:  Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity."
1,"Action-packed! Love Colin Firth!! A different, but suitable roll for him;( perfect"
1,"A great  romantic period piece... probably the best one I've seen in a long time... I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie.  The main characters of the movie end up together because despite their misfortunes & shortcomings they are alike in their character... their work ethic , passion and love and caring for other people eventually put them on the same path... the stronger of the two patiently endures but retains dignity and  makes it clear that a decision must be made or the two of them must take different paths."
0,It is not a bad movie. It had the potential to be a great movie. It needed better direction. Many of the scenes seemed to need a few more takes. It also could have used some story building with romance. Honestly it seemed to lack the necessary effort for greatness.
1,"I love the cast of this show, especially 7of9"
1,We all love this show! Great family show.
1,Entertaining movie. We enjoyed it and we rarely find a movie we both enjoy.
1,Funny.
1,My granddaughter & I watch this together.  We both love it!
1,Love to watch!!
1,"I prefer small stories, in which the people seem real and the circumstances are not contrived and this movie fits that bill"
1,"Great visuals and score, definitely watch on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible."
1,Get's goofier with each episode
1,Great action all-star actor's and performance
1,I love horror movies but typically stay away from mythical creature flicks. This movie was surprisingly entertaining and very well acted. The premise behind the creature stalking the small town was believable and palatable. I did not care for the ending.
1,Pretty good
1,"Pretty good very long tho, kept me interested"
1,As good as documentary film can be.
1,Fantastic movie w a twist at the end!!!
1,The characters are really being developed as it progresses...Good show..
1,An interesting premise with decent potential.  I was disappointed to see the full season was not already available to watch.
1,I am loving this new spinoff of the TWD.  I always wanted to know the beginning of the original.
1,It was better than I expected!
1,Good
1,He is talented.  Highly recommended.
1,Simply amazing buy it now
1,I love old sixties movies - especially British ones - but this is a little too dated and labored.  It has one message which it relentlessly tries to drive home and you never get to know (or care) about the characters.  It also has a &#34;60's&#34; hip unclear ending which is just annoying.
1,I have enjoyed all 5 seasons of Downton Abbey
1,Incredible acting in each scene. Byrne is wonderful.
1,Amazing
1,"Many sub plots and fast paced action. Really enjoy the show. Only negative, too many episode flash backs , that causes<br />Confusion."
1,Africa is one of my favorite  seasons. The personalities are big but there isn't as much backstabbing as you see in later seasons.
1,I want to watch more!
1,Exciting!
1,Looks like it was shot on a shoestring budget. Not that that's necessarily bad. It has an authentc courtroom feel  (if you can call this rabbinical tribunal a court). There are some unexplained peculiarities e.g. why does a character witness for the husband step into the role of his advocate? The ending with a shot of the wife's feet is also  mysterious and unexplained.
1,Excited for next season
1,"In almost every story, the period of discovery is my favorite. Because I have watched the sister show since day one, I was looking forward to seeing the time we missed while Rick was out cold. This did not disappoint. FTWD has a fresh feel with the new set to g, and teenage characters. The grownups are interesting too, the the female protagonist has had a few high profile roles lately such as House of Cards that get in the way for me. Great writing though so it works."
1,Love it
1,Classic 80's hit
1,Great series!
1,Way better the 2nd time through.
1,Love this movie!!!  A classic that everyone should see.<br /><br />Best movie of all time!!  Period the end!!
0,not watchable
1,A very happy little place to go. Perfect in its way.  What more can you ask for?
1,I loved it. Whoever decided to cancel this after one season shall forever be on my Poop List!
1,Superb.
0,"Not nearly as good as the book.  They definitely tried, but the story just doesn't translate on the screen as well as it did in book format.  Yet I found myself wondering if they'd do the sequel, so maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought!  ;-)"
1,After reading all the books I wanted to see how the movies stacked up. They did pretty well considering most movies are never as good or even close to being as good as the book.
1,"A great opportunity missed! The build-up, the drama, the suspense was really &#34;cooking&#34;, but the ending was a bit abrupt.Overall one of the better westerns out of New Zealand!"
1,Great show!  Really entertaining.  Robson Green and James Norton are a great pair to watch as they work together.  The stories are engaging and all of the acting is terrific.  Highly recommend.
1,My kids love it!
1,Loved it
1,The best!
1,"We rented this for our son, who seemed to really enjoy it. As far as movies for your tweens, I enjoyed it more than I expected."
1,I didn't like the ending.
0,Boring and tedious.
1,I never laugh out loud and I did multiple times with this show.  Hilarious!
1,"Smart, funny, bawdy couples humor! It's too bad that British series are so short. I'm looking forward to the next season."
0,Is ok movie
1,Laughed out loud!
0,Great potential but excessive vulgarity and profanity took the fun out of the movie.
1,I really enjoyed the movie. Lots of action.
1,"I'd watch it, again!"
0,"Brutal and unnecessary violence. Director could've proven his point in showcasing a younger James Bond concept without all the bloodshed, especially the church shooting scene."
1,This season is rather confusing.  Is like the writers weren't sure what to do after the end of season two.
1,Great action!
1,Not as good as the second one as far as scare/gross factor
1,Love it
1,This is the best videos I've seen for yoga. I fee amazing after every time I do it. Everybody needs to do this!
1,loved it
1,Amazing. Absolutely AMAZING!!!
1,"This is my first time learning about Jung, and I am speechless. So much good wisdom. So much I want to learn more about. So much truth."
1,One of the classics
1,Fantastic!  I truly do not want to see Kalinda go.
0,Slow. Not very interesting or informative. George C. Scott plays a great Patton but his talents are wasted  in this movie
1,Great movie!
1,Well written and perfectly cast. Great insight into the period and issues of the day.
1,"This first full-length feature from writer/director Talya Lavie presents a unique take on conscripted service into the IDF from a female perspective. The result is a Heller-esque tale replete with absurdities and inanities of military servitude.  It took a woman to tell this story.  Unlike other military movies, this one is almost entirely female - other than two smaller parts that come to mind, girls rule here.<br /><br />Lavie's script stitches together three loosely connected tales: &#34;01: The Replacement&#34;; &#34;02: The Virgin&#34; and &#34;03: The Commander&#34;. The constant in the three stories is the presence of Dana Ivgy as Zohar. Ms. Ivgy is a personal favorite dating back to [[ASIN:B000255L98 Broken Wings]]. She's a great actress and an arresting on screen presence even when dressing down or meant to be bristly and difficult like she is here.  Ivgy shines brightest in Lavie's 2nd story as the title character.<br /><br />The movie' surprise, though, is Nelly Tagar as Daffi.  She plays a big part in the first story, ostensibly training her replacement as she angles for reassignment in Tel Aviv. Tagar is a naturally gifted physical comedienne with fun, expressive eyes.  Her ability to cry on contact plays a big part in the story and to watch her to do it with aplomb -- and have you chuckle at the results -- is a real treat.  I was saddened to see her not appear n the second tale, but excited to see her return in the third and finale story, whose title -- The Commander -- is a neat little head fake from Lavie.<br /><br />The third star turn in the film is that of Shani Klein as Rama, a commander and boss to Zohar and Daffi.  I really liked Ms. Klein in this role.  Her Rama is a thin sheen of bluster with a sensitive core underneath. Zohar doesn't see it, but the audience can."
1,"Great movie, wish it was on dvd."
1,Same story of the movie Taken but with less quality actors
1,Good plot and excellent acting.
1,Well done and it kept me interested.  I will tune in for the next season too.
1,It's Amy Schumer.
1,A great drama and a compelling. story line. It was interesting to David.  Caruso in his.  pre Csi Miami role.
1,Great series....wish amazon would offer season 2 for prime members.
0,"Mad no cents, like this message"
1,One of my favorite series
1,Season 6 was a good ending to a great series. &#34;Glee&#34; makes you both laugh and cry. It's everything a show could hope to be and more.
1,Always at bedtime..puts me right to sleep all relaxed
1,I love this BBC production of Pride & Prejudice.  I've watched it so many times and never tire of it.  I think the actors were well cast for their roles and who wouldn't love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy?  Even though it's 6 episodes you'll want to watch them all back to back.
1,Excelent
1,A classic musical with catchy songs and spectacular dance numbers.
1,kids loved it
1,"This is a really funny movie, I love it."
1,Extremely fun!
1,Best baby kid show ever

1,An enjoyable movie for fans of Hercules.
1,"Great storytelling, great action, and great<br />acting!!!"
1,Love Love Love Downton Abbey
0,"Ordered this as rental for 'girls day' movie - we all were very disappointed! good potential, but bad story, bad ending"
1,"My wife and I think it's the best, we are watching it again!"
1,"Great family movie, but not really about faith as much as it is about a family bond."
1,Excellent series that makes you want to keep watching more every time!
1,A great show got involved more and more season two is even better than season one I can't wait for season three
1,Awesome movie flick<br />Watched it again and again
1,It was cute but slow moving.
1,The film starts you off in the middle of some action drama and through-out the whole experience makes you want to know what happens next.<br /><br />These type of stories and films are really more so short stories in my opinion that are great for viewing at least once. You get connected just enough to care if a character makes it to the end but at the same time you feel like you wanted a little more out the film.<br /><br />This is definitely a adult film in terms of content and the action scenes and don't recommend it for family viewing.<br /><br />Trying to keep this short; I wanted more from the film but at the same time I was satisfied enough with the content not to rage about it.
1,Wonderful movie!!!
1,"You can get hooked on this show. The writers and the cast does an excellent job conveying both the emotional aspects of their job,and challenges of home life. If you like action  drama then you will enjoy this show."
1,GREAT
1,Really a great second movie in the series.  I enjoyed it the entire way!
1,Looove
1,ALL FIVE SEASON'S WERE GREAT!!  A VERY GOOD SHOW THAT ENDED TOO SOON!
0,May be OK if you can stand the horrible special effects.
1,Very funny movie
1,Excellent acting and story continuity.
1,Good show. Always interesting.
1,"Great, very entertaining."
1,Awesome
1,Not worth watching
1,Charming offbeat whodunit.  Nice looking vicar whose mild manners and Concern for the village folk gets to the bottom of many a murky murder. Robson Green complements nicely. And lets not forget the bucolic charms of the English countryside.
1,Great show.  Bring it soon!
1,Amazing  and spell  binding.  Keeps  you  on  the  edge  of your  seat
1,"Clever, fun, thrilling. This was a great family (teenage and above) movie. The use of a camera POV is a great cinematic trick and makes for a fast-paced movie experience."
1,Great tango scene !
1,Had seen before......but good every time!!
0,movie for 15 year olds. Actors can't act and plot if routine and mundane.
1,Interesting and informative
1,A+++++

1,I've read all the books and really enjoyed the TV drama. Where the heck is Season 2?
1,Excellent movie!
0,Ridiculous scenes of violence. Went too far for humor.
1,Good solid story with a positive ending.  Slow moving at times and dialect often makes it hard to understand.  Worth you time to watch.
1,Love it
1,"The story was interesting, I really did like the movie a lot. Actually it was on SyFy the week of august 24th, I really liked it but I did not catch the name of it. It drove me nuts so over the following week end I called the company I have my cable with and I was lucky to get a super nice guy who really searched to get me the title, as soon as he found it, I checked on Amazon to see if the movie was available so I could own it and watch it as many times as I want.<br />Again, I thought it was a cool movie, I sure would recommend it."
1,well done performances by the two stars
1,"I love this show,  I'm not sure where they are going with it, but I find it very interesting."
1,Absolutely fantastic!!!!!
0,To much singing
0,kind of dragging along with predictable outcomes.
1,There were thrilling moments but much was predictable
1,Can't wait for season 3!
0,Totally changed the turtles.  It is sad to take an original great and allow it to be mutilated.
1,Sad. Local prosecutors should have been punished much more harshly. Michael Morton is an amazing man.
1,My 3 year old loves it!
1,"second time I'm watching this series. Excellent screen writing, love the humor and serious stuff all intertwined!"
1,Fascinating presentation of the unrivaled Marinsky Theatre!
1,Funny funny show
1,Entertaining movie with an excellent cast!
1,Good and exciting but the ending left you wondering the outcome of Escobar following that event.  Also wondered if this was a true story.  Kinda left you hanging.

1,"Interesting story line, I liked it."
1,Good movie about dirty cops.
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ»
1,Parents - show this movie to your children before they take on liberal academia. Christians will be challenged by their peers and by authority figures and they must be ready to defend their beliefs.
1,I'm hooked!
1,True stories of historical value must be told.  Very well done.
1,Buffy!
1,Good show to watch on a rainy day. B movie
1,It was an interesting perspective on a well loved celebrity.
1,This will keep you on the edge of your seat.
1,loved it as an adult and still love it. my kids love it to
1,Brian Green is always very good and understandable.
0,Lots of cussing. Not kid friendly
1,Catastrophe is the best comedy real life relationship. There no Hollywood romance cliche. Its about life situations and how ther are dealt with in modern society. Great show.  I'm looking foward to see the next season.
0,Old animation from the eighties. Be watchful beyond title before you purchase.
0,Started out with a relatively good story line and then desolved into smut..It was like they ran out of words .  Would not want to see the rest of it.
1,My 4yr old girl has seen the movie like 10 times. Se loves it. The soundtrack is spectacular as well!
1,Can't wait for the next season

1,Great memories....
0,Fair to middlin
1,fun
1,This is one of my two year old's favorite shows.  He loves this show and now he is starting to recognize his colors.
1,Great Show! Good story telling. Kids can't get enough.
0,I am a huge horror movie buff and I wasn't really that impressed with this one. The background soundtrack seemed cheap. The suspense was not really there. It had its moments but I expected more. I'm still confused by the way it began and how it ended.
1,"Despite having a rather slow start, the movie is extremely enjoyable.  It has an excellent premise, intricate architecture, and an ominous soundtrack that makes even the most mundane scenes more intense than they should be."
1,"This show is insane... as in INSANELY good!  The leads have FAB chemistry- you will LOVE them, even w/ their MANY, MANY flaws!"
1,Funnier if they'd played it straight.
1,Brings back old times.
1,"Great movie,  My grandaughter loved it!"
1,love this series !
1,"I remember watching when it first aired. I was in high school. Loved it then, love seeing new things watching now. Third season was the best. I will be watching again and again."
1,"Fantastic, it was one of the better movies I really liked the actors in the movie, and the combination of candid real performances they gave."
1,My 3 yr old loves this show
1,Really great!!  Very cute for kids and adults.
1,No comments.
0,A time period story hampered by a low budget and actors with limited acting skills. Definitely not for most viewers.
1,Funny
1,This show is the best! Above v. below the house. Very historically informative and entertaining!
1,Helloooooo Raylan!!!!!
1,"A brilliant adaptation of Alan Gln's novel 'Dark Fields'. Bradley Cooper has just the right combination of the 'Everyman' morphing into pure intellectual power with the help of a mysterious designer drug. Abby Cornish and Robert DeNiro provide superb performances; with Mr DeNero in particular providing an understated, yet compelling role as a business tycoon.  Cooper's transformation from a slacker copywriter into super investment analyst show the full range of his actor's range, while demonstrating the vulnerabilities and missteps of Eddie Spinaola a &#34;regular guy&#34;, reeling from the intense pressure of his transformation.<br /><br />While the screenplay deviates from the novel, it retains much of the intense pace and hyper realism of the original.  Do not miss this one!"
1,No problems
0,What dies this movie have in common with a shop vac? They both suck out loud. The movie was barely entertining at best. My son & I had higher expectations. The Arnold Schwarzenegger Hercules movie was more enjoyable & entertaining. That's just my two cents worth.
1,This is one of the best .
1,This is a very well performed and exciting series...language and scenes are general audience rated.
1,Love this show!!
1,Awesome!
1,Average. No laugh out loud moments.
1,excellent
0,"&#34;I dont care who he is , if he didnt want to get run over he shouldent have got crippled&#34; This quote was the best line in the movie, wish I could get back the 20 min I spent on this."
1,Fine series with great action and sometimes need to grab a tissue
1,"Great science fiction, lots of twists and turns!"
1,it was okay
1,Entertaining for my 3 year old!!
0,"It would have been interesting to see how a civilized society can collapse due to a disease epidemic in spite of efforts of goverment, police, doctors and media to avert a disaster.  Goverment appears nonexistent, police are either stormtroopers or looking out for themselves, and the media are limited to the few seconds of screen time and only in passing. There are no interviews with police, firemen, paramedics or witnesses, a riot occurs and only one camera is out to record it. Hundreds of other cell phones stay in pockets, no one tweets or post to social media. The characters must be on a plan with no data, no text and very limited minutes because they only call on occasion and don't bother to convey any useful information. When bit the victims seem content to sit and die if there is no answer on 911. To summarize the social and civil milieu is not remotely believable. I won't comment on the characters as they are already taking a beating. I can suspend disbelief for zombies but the rest is asking too much."
1,"Plot wasn't as good, the tribute at the end was a nice touch, rip paul"
0,what is this did i browse this by accident  look I am no prude but this looks like trash
1,Meh. First two seasons were great. Starting to wear a bit.
1,"Wow!  A movie to watch over and over, especially if you are having trouble with your faith.  The writers were spot on for todays society"
1,Best animation of the year.  Kidman really draw you into her mean character.  Makes you forget that she's Nicole. Paddingtin comes to life right out of the books
1,It just keeps you coming back for more. The characters are fantastic and play off each other very well. I am binge watching and love it.
1,Granddaughter loved it
1,Love the show can't wait for season four..
1,My 4 year old loves it!
1,Wonderful!
1,"Very well done. Simply done with humor and logic that a five year old can easily understand. It asks the viewer to help find objects, tells a good story, has riddles that children can understand.<br /><br />I recommend this show."
1,A nail biting expirence!
1,The best
1,One of my son's favorite shows!
1,"Watched every episode thought it was a good adaptation of the source material with enough reworking to keep you guessing, great actors"
1,Love it! Nucky is the man.
0,Somewhat simpler plot lines so far than Season 1. Body count continues to climb as individual moral character continues to decline.
0,"Awful.  Full of profanity, horrible plot.  Stopped watching after the first 15 minutes or so.  Wasn't worth wasting my time over.  Do yourself a favor - find something else."
1,"If you're into current events or politics and/or a news junky you'll probably like this show.  They do a good job developing the characters, and it's interesting seeing the inner workings of the news room... Assuming it's accurate, which I don't work in the news so I have no idea if it is, but I've enjoyed the show so far!"
1,"Pretty good show,kind of sad."
1,Very funny sexy comedy with lots of British humor
1,Winona Ryder's Academy Award nominated performance makes this classic story a must watch movie. Thomas Newman's soundtrack also very good.
1,"You should do this. Not that other thing, this one."
1,Think I am going to like this show -  have heard great reviews about it
1,Some of the most frightening images and unsettling scenes I have seen in a horror film!
1,Not bad for an old sci-fi series.  Too bad the series didn't last more seasons before being canceled.  Ahead of it's time maybe.  Only a few of the cast went on to other shows though.
1,Great show.
1,"It's not a bad program and well done, but the genre is so over worked these days. We sure need someone who can change the course with new genres altogether with little to do with cops, detectives, emergency rooms and doctors. I have the feeling that because reality programs and cop/legal/detective/doctor/ER shows have an adequate audience that programmers believe that's all there is. WRONG!. So, if you (ho hum) would like to watch another cop show (I don't care what minute twist is involved), then I would recommend it. It's not that bad.  -Daniel Lance Wright, author of &#34;One Day in Lubbock&#34;, &#34;Phobia&#34;, &#34;Paradise Flawed&#34; &#34;Defining Family&#34;, &#34;The Last Radiant Heart&#34;, &#34;Annie's World: Jake's Legacy&#34;, &#34;Six Years' Worth&#34;"
1,Very clever and funny.
1,Just what I was looking for. Very exciting show to watch. I would watch again.
1,I would give more stars if you had them.  Love this series.  Hope it continues for several more years.
1,Great O Movie
1,Sweet
1,"Muy buena ,recomendable"
1,Grandson loves it!!
1,Good until about half way when it became more fantasy
1,Mob movie with strong woman character.
1,A charmer...&#34;Iris&#34; provides an example to all of us on how to stay vital and grow old with dignity.
1,Binge watching!
1,They need to work on the graphics
1,Interesting show.
1,Funny and entertaining!
1,This series just gets better and better.
0,Is typical low budget slasher movie.
1,I love Jason Bateman but the characters surrounding him are......well unbelievable.  No one could be that stupid or self absorbed........could they?
1,"Hilarious, over the top and just great!"
1,Enjoyed very much
1,"Awesome, most likely I will buy it just to have in my Library"
1,Provocative and well acted.  I want to see where this story goes.
1,The one and only Bill Buckley
1,Another great TV series.  Shame it didn't continue.
1,The best Hercules yet
1,"somewhat ok , but needs more action than it has right now , has potential to be a good series"
1,Finally found out who A was!
1,"If you like Larry's humor, this is one of his best films.  The acting is good and there is a decent plot.  Larry's humor is at its best... He's a local Deputy Sheriff protecting a &#34;witness&#34; who is being held by bogus witness protection guys.  The witness is a lady who starts out being snooty and offensive, but, after a while with Larry, she turns out to be a likeable, compliant companion to Larry who is attracted to her but who remains loyal to his girl back home... This may be the best of the Larry &#34;movies.&#34;  The supporting actors are really good."
0,Each season has gotten progressively worse with the profanity.<br />Otherwise I like the show.
1,Good one.
1,"Enjoy the turns and twists of this show.  And, who wouldn't like Hally Berry?"
1,Love my SciFi shows and this does not disappoint!
1,"Great animation, my kids ages 5 and 8 enjoy all seasons so far!"
1,Love this show as kid and reliving it
1,"Originally seen when it opened in early 50s .<br />It still impresses me with the outstanding performances, special effects but more importantly , the message (warning) to<br />Earth that is needed today ."
1,One of the best comedies ever created. The two main characters have a perfect  exchange of one liners....
1,My son loves this show!
0,A yawning good time.
1,"Nice and kind of sad, but overall good movie."
1,Good old comedy.
0,"Pretty boring, Montage of Heck was much better insight of Nirvana and better made."
1,Awesome show
1,The acting in this movie was good. Enjoyed it.
1,Male version of Sex in the city...so good Lewis you wanting more!
1,"Watched two episodes, there were lots of laughs.  I need comic relief lately, this was good comic relief."
1,Awesome stories! It has been incredible to see how my brother Steve helped others through being an organ donor. He died too young but gave to others in his life and in his death. Really great show! Love! I want more seasons!!!!
1,Great for little girls 3yrs old
1,Great series.... and it even has an 'ending'!!
1,Enjoyable
1,An Oscar-nominated gem. It's unique and so unlike anything we've seen recently. A beautifully shot film that offers an austere style supporting an intriguing story of life in the shadow of ISIS terror. Highy Recommended.
1,Good show. I'm ready for the next season
1,great show. This is the predecessor of Sons of Anarchy. Same crazy stuff.
1,Amazing!  Oldie but goodie!  I continue to see it over and over.  Clint Eastwood is great and so is the cat and mouse game played throughout the plot.
1,I listen to this on NPR radio and enjoy the visual to go with the stories.  Something fun and different to watch.
1,Love this show. I love the relationship that the guys have and think the show is really funny. Ari is probably my favorite character and I love the relationship he has with his wife. This is a great show to watch when you want to relax and don't want something too &#34;heavy&#34;
1,Absolutely fantastic.
1,Like this series
1,"This is a classic, I try to pick out movies that my family hasn't seen, sometimes it's easier sometimes a bit more difficult.  It kept my 14 year old, gadget obsessed son, entertained. These old movies rely on the actors skill and not special effect or fancy camera shots. Harvey is a joy, it's worth the time to share with the family."
1,"Very entertaining, particularly if you like music."
1,Love the franchise better ever better with mark Wahlberg
1,Great family movie
1,Awesome movie. Totally worth buying.
1,"You wouldn't think it, but this actually works."
1,I'm currently binge watching it and it entertains me but the acting is lacking. Also I very recently watched Downton Abbey (which I enjoyed very much) and that maybe negatively influencing my opinion of Mr. Selfridge.
1,"My kids love it, its entertaining and educational, they're learning so much about nature."
1,"Fresh, funny, clever!"
1,I enjoy watching Mind of a Chef.  It's great to watch how creative these chefs are.
1,great special effects but a little too much like a soap opera for me
1,realistic tv entertajnment
1,Waiting for next season.
0,It's quite like watching a B movie...I so enjoy Walking Dead and this pales in comparison.
1,Good quality
0,my wife enjoyed it...
1,Excellent!
0,Probably a good movie if you're a fan of the books and young. Not great if you're an adult looking for a good sci-fi movie to watch. Overall not as good as other similar genre movies like Hunger Games of Maze Runner
1,my 3 boys love it - so not just for girls... but show could use a bit more gender mix...
1,Keeps us hanging on...
1,Excellent show!
1,I Like &#34;The Rock&#34;and I am a fan of Hercules movies. This one did not disappoint. I thought they did a great job with it and Dwayne makes a great Hercules.
1,"Sweet story, lovely ending.  The fact that it was Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero, who have their own love story, just grabbed me.  Such a romantic!"
1,GREAT movie.
1,Excellent movie!!
1,Excellent series
1,I was not familiar with the Poldark series of books or the previous series in the 70's. So glad someone mentioned this to me. I watched the whole series over the weekend and am thrilled to hear that the second season is coming next year.<br /><br />Interesting story line of a British soldier fighting the American Revolutionary war and returning home to Cornwall afterward. The characters are well written and casting and location just pefect.
1,great !
1,Great actress. Nice story. Human interest high.
1,Great movie
1,A good entertaining show all the way though.
1,"Fun, original, great music"
1,Victoria makes the film superb.
1,"Incredibly written, and exquisitely filmed. Brokeback Mountain contains scenes that haunt you long after it ends."
1,Really nice
1,I liked it.
1,Adult only show with great acting.
1,Pacino is Awesome in this.
1,Never a dull moment!!!
0,Terrible
1,Can't stop watching this fast-paced series.
0,waste of time. You will find out within the first 5 minutes.
1,"Finally a thoughtful, witty, and sometimes crass comedy.  Highly recommended"
1,Love every single one of these characters in this show. Young people need to knock off watching reality shows and watch a few episodes of this.  Quit watching nonsense. Get a dose of what's really happening out there. Great show for husband and wife to watch together. I can't get enough.
1,"The story line is a bit over the top at times, but fun to watch. Well acted throughout."
1,Great stuff!
1,My husband and I loved it.<br />Wish we had another season.
1,Great! Everyone should watch this
1,Good information about that era.
1,Awesome series but they added a crap intro to the episodes.
1,Missing all of these characters after a couple of intense binge-watching weeks. Excellent story of good vs evil and all of the gray area in between in an unusual US location that many of us know little to nothing about.
1,Best series I've ever seen.
1,My husband and I enjoyed this wonderful movie.  We highly recommend watching it.
1,I love it!!! I can't wait to get it on DVD!!!
1,very helpful grandson in class aswe speak
1,Interesting story line and I have no idea where it's going from here.
1,Action in each episode along with nudity-some-and interesting twists.
1,"I'd heard about Dollhouse when it was airing but never dedicated the time to watch it. Glad I was able to catch it on Amazon. Interesting plot line, great characters!"
1,Very good
1,This show hits all the human emotions.  It is well written and very entertaining.
0,really slow and boring.
1,Very funny-very clever
1,The best show ever
1,"wonderful movie, highly recommended for those classic movie buffs. Leslie Howard recommended Bogart for his role in this movie which he deeply appreciated, even naming his daughter Leslie he considered this a starter for his career. Sadly Howard died at a young age in his fifties as well as Bogey, Howard died in a suspicious plane disaster."
1,Breathtaking!
1,Superbly done. An excellent outline of urban history.
1,One of top ten shows EVER!
0,Over rated.
1,"Great action, suspenseful and keeps you very interested !"
1,"Sometimes you just need something that's not bang, bang, and a good laugh"
1,"This murder mystery was well presented and acted.  Unfortunately,I found the story to be very formulated and unoriginal.  Identification of the culprit was lacking also.  Relative to the plethora of other similar detective stories, the best I can do is brand it as average."
1,Didn't think I would like nearly as much as I do.  Good series
1,"Really enjoying this series.  CIA, action and good relationship building.  You'll like it a lot if you like things like NCIS LA, NCIS type series - a little quirky but fun!"
1,This is older but good travel show. I have enjoyed Burt Wolfe over the years and was glad to find them on Amazon.
1,Very refreshing show! It will suck you in from the moment you hit play.
0,"Storyline is unbelievable. Who falls deeply in love with a kidnapper in less than 4 days? Who decides to run across the border, with your child, and start a new life with a kidnapper willingly?"
1,This movie was a let down and I sure wouldn't rent it again. Didn't even finish watching it.
1,"I am very excited and hopeful for this new spin on the Walking Dead. I am loving that this does not drop you in the middle of the action, and allows the story to do some developing before all the chaos we know has to happen ensues. So far I am please with how the first episode played out. There was some action and the first look at zombies in LA, what a contrast from the original."
1,I like this show but how the season 2 ended..idk. Content wise def 4 stars.
1,Great show
0,Awful
0,"A re-tread of other, better (?) films ('The Thing', and especially 'Virus' (1999))."
1,Ok this is all 80s miami vice action flick with some awesome 80s music. If you like steve Lang (avatar) this is a must movie to see. Few movies do the outcast delinquents into vigilante crusaders well like this movie. WELL WORTH THE RENT
1,Awesome as per usual!
0,"Boring, I could not get interested.  To much discord."
0,Homosexual movies should let us know before we waste time watching some of the movie.
1,Love it.
1,"I'll try to keep this spoiler free.<br /><br />A lot of information and evidence was presented that made my wife and me wonder what really happened to TWA 800.  There were enough things in the official investigation that were handled in a unusual manner to make me question the whole investigation and final report.  I personally can't conclude what happened was incompetence, arrogance, and / or cover-up, etc.<br /><br />The show kept our attention the whole time, moved with a nice pace, and didn't seem heavy-handed.  It presented some technical information, but in an approachable way.  I heartily recommend it, and then you can draw your own conclusions to what really happened."
1,The only part I didn't like was the repetition  which appeared in each one.
1,"An entertaining, well done show."
1,Enjoyed it
1,"Fantastic movie! Great for the kids and a wonderful movie for adults to enjoy, too."
1,I thought it was very good. Looking forward to more.
1,My 3 yr old daughter loves it- very cute
1,Can't wait for season 2
1,"Grandkids love it, which is why I bought it."
1,Didn't know who sac was until this movie. Well done!
1,Fun to relive the excess of the 80s
1,"Love this picture, just when I think I got it bam there is a new twist."
1,Any fan of Christopher Guest will see his fingerprints all over this hilarious series.
1,The movie is great and I loved watching it.  Acting was good.  Story was story.
1,It is entertaining.
1,Never thought I would like another round of the TMNT but this was a great movie! Kids and adults in my house loved it.
1,Great series and story line.
1,well written plots!
1,Great for everyone
1,Awesome
0,"Might be great if it had closed captioning so I could understand the dialog.  Amazon has no concern or regard for people with disabilities like hearing deficits, and so chooses not to support closed captioning for a 2-3 year old Sony Bravo TV that comes with Amazon Video built in.  Amazon should be ashamed of itself."
1,I love this show and love Tom Selleck in it.
1,Good
1,"This is a great movie! My girls love it as they are fond of the songs and the story. It's also nice that the story teaches about older siblings being nice to the younger ones, which is something my eldest daughter (5 yrs old) has picked up quickly from watching the movie."
1,Great season! Really keeps your attention from one episode to the next.
0,"Very good production values (Executive Produced by Spielberg, so it ought to), strong cast but writing is dreadful (sorry Ed, this anachronistic drama is clearly not your thing...)"
1,A+
1,Great show!! I recommend watching it.
1,Really enjoyed this!
1,I loved the character development  can't wait to see the next one
1,Great movie lots of action and surprises.
1,Totally Awesome!  Love The X Files!
1,my  grandaughter  likes  this
1,Love it. Glad to see the gang again.
1,The Good Wife is a great show. So well done and smart. I am just sad that I finished watching Season 6 and now have to wait for Season 7. I love binge-watching!
1,Great series.
1,Really enjoyed the movie. This person's opinion.
1,"Cute but average.  Likeable main cast and supports, but not all that plausible.  Great for a diversion while ironing."
0,Too raunchy to enjoy anything that might have made it worth watching.  I turned it off half way through.
1,I enjoyed the movie and found the acting acting and entertainment value hight.
1,All in all a good movie with a good plot and a twist. Smartly written.
1,One of my favorites.
1,Well Acted and a good script.  Off center but a good movie.
1,"Very slow moving. Wasn't pleased with the ending although I guess it couldn't have ended any differently. I would not recommend it as a purchase item. When it reaches Netflix and it doesn't cost any more than the monthly rental fee, I would say give it a shot."
1,WHEN IS THE NEXT EPISODE!!!!!??????? i MUST HAVE IT!
0,In a word - BORING!
1,Loved how easy it was to order and watch the movie!!
1,Just great. Can't stop watching 24!
0,not for me I dont like these movies tried and still dont
1,"Wonderful, I can see those who do not have a love for acting, do not appreciate it quite as much as others. The acting was phenomena; most complain it is long, yet it is a good story I wish it was longer. You need to appreciate it for what it is. Can we get a bravo for one of the smaller roles, one of the actor portrayed it beautifully. The one who was always chewing gum, I thought it was a great detail and part to the movie! Will watch this again! It will make you think!"
1,Good
1,"Other than the original, this is my favorite Star Trek series. Just finishing up watching the entire series for the second time. Must be hooked."
1,Great acting and we'll written characters.
1,"Well done, and interesting glimpse behind the then Iron Curtain.  Perhaps more interesting to Red Wing fans, but still has broad appeal to sports and political junkies alike."
1,"Great acting on timely matters.  Sometimes I thought Mac's raving was a bit much, maybe just over my head.<br />Overall, a teriffic show."
1,"Good movie, gives u heads up as to wat can go on over there"
0,Very poor quality copy
1,Great Movie totally funny with a laugh a minute
1,Gran-children enjoyed watching this movie.
1,"Amazing show, it's a must watch."
1,My 6 year old daughter is a fan of princess Sophia and those types of shows. I showed her this show and she really enjoyed it and is excited to watch them all.
1,My 3 yr old son loves it.
1,Great movie enjoy watching as family teaching about the truth
1,Interesting plot line but not sure how long not knowing each other's past and emotions can carry the show.<br /><br />Actors grew on me as the series went on. I would not recommend it to everyone.
0,"Not sure if story exist, it seems they depend on the audience to come to their own conclusion, confusing end to confusing story"
1,"The story was a little different, not a hi budget film."
1,"decent movie, good for killing some time with the family..."
1,Mindlessly entertaining
1,Cute movie
1,Great tween teen movie not outdated
1,"It is  a classic Horror Film ,one of the best !"
1,Nice movie
1,I love Chappie! A funny and action movie...
1,Not quite as good as the first Exotic Marigold Hotel.
1,cant wait for season 2
1,love It!! awesome show!! love halle berry and can't wait to watch it from week to week.
1,Waiting for season 6 to come on prime
1,Great family movie
1,Fell asleep.
1,Hilarious and campy. Made with love for the fans of the genre. :)
1,5 stars!
1,"EXTEMELY intense, but VERY well done. Unique, with great characters and script."
1,The grandchildren loved it.
1,Love the show
1,Entertaining. Don't respect Lisa and her filthy husband. Why did she need to do background check on Quad?<br />stupid Lisa.
1,entertaining
0,I don't care who thinks this movie is good the premise is shallow there is little in thew way of any explanation and the acting is very thin. For those who insist that you need to read the book I have to say any movie that demands some prior knowledge of the story by reading a book is a piece of garbage.  Or let me say it this way if you liked The Grudge you'll love this movie.
1,"If you liked Morse, you will like this too. Lewis and his new sidekick are a great pairing.I have seen later series and they are all brilliant, but I had not seen the first series until now - excellent viewing. Stick with it as the later series are even better."
1,"There is never a Stephen King movie or TV show that is not horribly flawed.  Under the Dome is no exception. If you watch these adaptations, you know what you are getting into.  For whatever reason, King just does not translate well from book to screen.  It's not terrible."
0,"It's all build up to a lousy ending.  It's like the writers ran out of time and just put &#34;the end&#34; in a hurry<br />after writing the first 2 hours worth.  Also several illogical parts, for instance, when it's the end of the world with<br />very few people left, how do you drive up in a shiny clean car, let alone after driving hundreds of miles<br />through roads and towns that are NOT maintained, and likely unpassable in many spots?"
1,Very good
1,I love Banshee.
1,"Sorry this was ended after 2 seasons, thought the show was good."
1,My kids love this show!
1,Wonderful movie. Right mix of interesting characters.
1,"EARLY PLOT SPOILER<br /><br />The best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of &#34;Hauser's Memory.&#34; Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.<br /><br />Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say &#34;Hauser's Memory&#34; but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.<br /><br />Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?"
0,"I really love time travel movies, but I totally hated this movie.<br /><br />It didn't actually feel like a time travel movie to me, but it was just a do-over-your-mistakes movie.<br />The guy could only travel back within his own lifetime to moments that he could remember.<br />So, whenever he would say something wrong, he could just go back and do it over.<br />Whenever he did the wrong thing or regretted not doing someting, he would just go back and do it over.<br /><br />As soon as this time travel thing was explained and the guy tried it a few times, I was completely bored and annoyed with the whole movie.<br />I didn't like the way that he could just play with people.<br />As the movie progressed, I stopped caring enough to pay attention to how ridiculous the story became.<br /><br />If this was me, I would immediately go to find out what yesterday's winning lottery numbers were, or what horses won at the races yesterday.<br />Then I would go back to yesterday morning and go win everything."
1,Great actors and looks to be a good story.  I would definitely watch
1,Great storylines..
1,Loved it.
1,This movie is absolutely one of the best parodies I have seen. This whole cast and the guy who play Brian Millers is hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing at certain scenes. The fight scene towards the end was I'm sorry the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in a movie.
1,It was ok a little strange I thought but oh well
0,Wrong movie was attached to stream
1,terrific movie!
1,Excellent
0,I love this series and looked forward to seeing it again. However I was furious that the video had closed caption on my iPad and none when viewed on my TV. What gives?!
1,Excellent
1,Awesome Movie
1,It was ok a bit predictable
1,5 star
0,awful
0,I turned this movie off a quarter of the way through.  Not the best acting and predictable.
1,"This looks interesting.  I'm a big Cranston and Ribisi fan, so that helps.  This has a lot of intrigue going in.  I'm hoping that Amazon picks it up."
1,Excellent show. Reminds of me of Star Trek's earlier seasons. Great cast and unexpected plot twists and surprises. Looking forward to next season.
1,"Very good, but cut short at only three seasons."
1,"Weird, but not in a dislike way.. has some interesting qualities"
1,We have really enjoyed the Newsroom. The characters are a little crazy but the dialogue is wonderful- the writer is amazing. We are now watching season 3 and dread when it will be over!
1,It's ageless.
1,Just good English mystery show.  Not an over the top pretentious program like Inspector Morris could be at times (still a great show) but just entertaining.
1,"Love the show,I recommend this show to every one, start season one."
1,good mystery
1,What a great perk on Amazon Prime. My 4-year-old loves this series. We are all learning some French! Little Pim is a cute panda and the video includes both animated skits with Pim and friends and pictures/videos of real people and things. There is enough repetition to aid in learning and the narrative is clear and easy to follow. The entire video is in French for a good immersive experience for ages toddler to adult.
1,Watch it
1,"Very entertaining and educational and our son loves the shows, so that's good enough for me! Catchy songs!!"
0,PURE FILTH
1,Interesting but I could only find episode 1. Is there more?
1,Great show! I Loved the way they talked to each other.
1,We love it
1,Highly entertaining show
0,"If thats reality, I am moving to the wilderness."
1,"Well... its ok. Its not as funny as the first one. I still love Kevin James, but I'd say, wait until Netflix and you can get it for cheap!"
1,love this show!
1,"It's just simply funny. Being a silent film, visual humor is key and is exceptionally well done. Excellent film."
1,One of my favorite movies of all time! Fantastic movie!
0,80% of the movie are  old
1,Laughed out loud often. Very funny writing and likable characters. Sad it was only 6 episodes!
1,DEADWOOD WAS MAGNIFICENT. I WAS CLUED TO THE TV.
1,very good story on how to test your courage
1,Great movie!
1,excellent! kids loved it.
1,"All around enjoyable series! Good, CLEAN entertainment!"
1,My students love to watch this during lunchtime...and so do I.
1,Great show
1,Very cute
1,"A fun old movie. Yes way too sexist but it was the 60's snd although I don't want to go back, it is fun, sometimes, to look back in a controlled way."
1,"Great movie, and how they created the roles of a much younger crew in a modern time. A must see for all Trekkies."
1,Loved it and was all excited to continue watching!  Hope it makes the cut.
1,Enjoyed both movies a lot. They arrived as scheduled.
1,A very fun show. My 4 year old daughter and 1 year old son love it!
1,GORDON.
0,"Shark week has continuously gotten worse over the last few years, plus no Amazon option to buy the whole series with daily access to new programing = we're done with shark week for good!"
1,I didn't finish it ðŸ˜Ÿ.  I lost interest in it
1,"Love, love, love this show! Tatiana is a very talented actor with a great support cast and plot line!"
1,Too much of chasing each other around and not enough story.
1,"Well made movie of unknown actors with a great, darkly humorous story line. Don't look away or you'll miss clues and hints of what's<br />to come. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Sad, funny, all the good elements of a keeper."
1,By far besd Godzilla movie!!
1,"I have seen all the seasons of Supernatural now, and they only get better and better"
1,Pretty good
1,I certainly hope they opt to present us with another season.  Fascinating story line.
1,An amazing story told magnificently.
1,Its Okay
1,Granddaughters love it.
1,Beautiful story full of relevance for today's hidden homeless. Powerful performances by Streep and Nicholson.<br />As unforgettable as Grapes of Wrath.
1,Big eye opener to reality... A must see!!
1,"Bob the Builder is an excellent, wholesome kids show. Besides that, claymation is off the hizzy!!!"
1,A good film that's worth a look.
1,The movie was AWESOME!!!! All the actors were AWESOME!! Waiting for part 2
1,Great Show!  I know musicians and conductors like this!
1,"My 9-yr old son and I LOVE this movie. So truthful and artistic.  I just wish great movies like these were more advertised.  It didn't even play in my area, nor available in the movie stores, which they said they never heard of it. I had to wait for Amazon. THANK YOU!!!"
1,funny banter between the 2 characters.
0,"Didn't bother to finish it. It was out of sync and difficult to watch. We tried it twice, but it was too annoying to watch."
1,Surprisingly funny and real
1,The whole family likes this show.
1,Love the series. This season is definitely not my favorite. Bring back Derek Hale.
1,Very entertaining
1,"Classic, who could say more? &#34;Quick, I'm going to get you quick! Quick,&#34; ðŸ˜© ðŸ˜ Ha one of Eddie Murphy's best!"
1,A must-see for anyone that eats food!
1,Good movie.  Lots of action.  Well made.  Definitely not a B type movie.
1,Wow.
1,"The entire crew enjoyed this premier issue.Our audience for this show ranged from 4 to 47, with a 6,8,9 11 and 35 year olds the middle. I'd love to see more episodes of this potential series. My middle aged kids really enjoyed the play on the familiar storyline."
0,"Even Kat Denning's Jovian bust size can't save this mediocre &#34;quriky horror comedy.&#34; I put those words in quotations because this film wishes it was really a quirky horror comedy, rather than the mess of utter lameness it is. Its attempts at being clever fall flat, as it desperately clings onto the annoying indie comedy tropes that make the genre insufferable rather than ingenious comedy.<br /><br />If you want a funny horror comedy, go watch Odd Thomas, cause I'm sure the makers of this film certainly liked both the book and the film."
1,I love this show......
1,I really liked it
1,"A truly unusual story, with fine performances by Joaquim and Paltrow."
1,Nice!
1,Some of the best television produced.
1,"Very graphic violence and sex scenes. Costuming, set and characters are excellent."
0,It didn't take long for the episode to follow and imitate all HBO series with flagrant sex scenes.  I discontinued watching as soon as it came on.
1,can't believe there isn't a season 4 - best show on tv
1,Action packed
1,Loved this series!
1,Loved it
0,At this point I am just fed up with Hank Moody.  He is his own worst enemy and will never change.  Karen needs to run and run far!
0,Very different from the book. Unnecessarily rushed in all the wrong places. Characters have little development.
1,Great show! Prequel adds insight to how later ST shows got there. Nice spin on how the human/vulcan relationship developed. Creative writing in the ST tradition.
1,classic Movie.. Have always loved this one. For Horse movie watchers this one is a must. If you grew up in the 1970s or 1980s you will surely remember this one.
0,Somewhat entertaining but disappointing.
1,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought Dave Franco really made this movie. He had an awkward humor  which I truly enjoyed watching. I did not know that Vince vaungh was so tall and Dave Franco was so small! I liked the message this movie portrayed of how to never give up on your dreams keep going for what you believe In. Their also was another message on how bullying has now gone beyond school with social media's sites giving bullies the opportunity to continue their behavior after school hours.cWhich makes it hard for parents to help their child who is being bullied find a solution.  But, what Vince Vaungh told his son made perfect sense to stand out, be different. You do not want to be like everyone else. Overall I really enjoyed watching this film."
0,"didn't watch complete documentary - if you can call it a documentary. Not an objective piece, but rather one more &#34;open border&#34; propaganda film  from your friends on the left."
1,https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ESNDQWY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
0,Disappointed
1,"I just love Michael Rosenbaum in everything he does and this show doesn't disappoint, although it isn't for everyone.  It is quite entertaining and I look forward to a new episode every week.  I really hope it gets renewed for another season."
0,Terrible. The sequel is not worth renting.
1,I would give Blue Bloods at 5 star because mostly it is decent family entertainment providing a good example of how a family can work together as they grow up and stay in close contact.  I say mostly because the violence on the criminal and cop side does not have to be so vivid.
1,"It's embarrassing, but I'm an addict. I can't get enough of Homeland. Even episodes that are mediocre are beautifully executed and wonderfully entertaining."
1,I'm obsessed! And the viewing quality is great! ;)
1,"Tightly written, well layered drama with compelling, if neurotic, characters. Fun to watch."
1,"If you want to watch a simple movie that is full of laughter,  then you will enjoy Friday."
1,Inspiring
1,This is an ok series.
1,2 tumbs up
1,I like the shows a lot from season 1 thru 12 I am getting ready to buy the rest of the seasons
0,"As a soccer movie targeted to adults is very unreallistic. Some fantastic moves usually not seen in competivive leages such as EPL or La Liga.<br />As a feel-good, fantasy story targeted to kids and teenages, there is a lot of suggestive material that sjoukd make it R rated."
1,Need more seasons lots more! Great show!!!
1,Well acted and great ending.
0,Very simplistic portrayal of a significant and uplifting story
1,"for all kids. more fun than a barrel of evil monkeys and exhausted rhinocerouses.. rhinocerii? sucks us into its world, just like the game."
1,Great writing and cast. On par with your favorite HBO shows.
0,not worth the time or money to watch which is sad when you look at the cast actors in this. Really deserves a lower rating.
1,Like The show.
1,Great! Kids loved it.
1,"I enjoyed it, but then again, that is what I like to watch.."
1,"I used to watch this show growing up. I is amazing how classic shows can still make us laugh - no sex, no dirty language...just clean humor, great acting and funny bits. Great as a family show, or just a night of relaxing TV while you work on other projects. I love shows like this when I am sewing or painting...just some funny background noise."
1,"My kids love this show and as a parent it's not annoying at all. It also teaches spelling and rhyming, letters and vocabulary. Great little songs too."
1,Very funny
0,Not worth your time
0,pathetic
1,Great series!
1,Can't beat Larry David
1,Great action drama!!
1,Good movie.
1,"I love this series. Pierce Gagnon,the kid who plays Ethan is a joy to watch."
1,Got here fast.thanks.
0,We put this on as a joke.  I wanted to run from my house screaming to get away from Megan Fox's acting.  I may never be able to sleep again at night.
1,Great successor to Hill Street Blues!
1,One of my favorite shows! My 3 year old loves it to!
1,Enjoy watching the series
1,A good watch
0,"I think I would have really liked the movie, but the audio/video playback was super messed up and it was crazy frustrating.  The trailer worked fine, but on the movie itself, the picture was behind the audio track so it was like watching the characters lip synch, BADLY, throughout the whole movie.  It wasn't just a couple seconds either, but like 10 seconds behind, so they were onto the next scene sometimes in the audio, but you would see the actors mouthing what the other actors had said in the last shot.  It made the story really hard to follow.  I thought maybe it was my TV, but then I tried another Amazon rental and the audio/picture on that one worked just fine, it was just this movie.  I even tried logging out and back in and unplugging and plugging. I gave it my best shot to fix it on my own, but unfortunately, nothing worked.  Its too bad too b/c it looked like a great movie!"
0,Pointless and awful acting
1,4 1/2 stars.  Wonderful movie!
1,"Kind of wordy and you are somewhat beat over your head with their views, but generally a good show."
0,lousy concept--To much sex---not for me!
0,"Michael Douglas was great per usual, but the story line was not for me. Had I read the synopsis before watching it, I'd have passed."
1,This adaptation is by far the best!
1,"Awesome.  This is great &#34;guys&#34; show with great action, good acting, solid script, bombs and guns, and female anatomy laced in nearly every episode.  If you a fan of the Transporter series, this is several levels better."
1,Better than I expectedd
1,Entertaining shows for my 4 year
1,Okay movie
1,"Very well done, great story. Unexpected ending but not implausible."
1,Great JL movie if you a fan or not this is an entertaining movie.
1,"Great show! Makes you cry, makes you laugh. Sometimes the suspense is a little much but it's makes the show!"
1,very funny and clever
1,PRETTY GOOD AND INTERESTING
1,I&#34;m having GREAT time watching this series!!!  Keri Russell is AWESOME!!!
1,"Poorly written, cliche"
1,"excellent show, great characters. sorry to see it end."
1,Loved it...waiting on episode 2!
1,Classic
1,My 3 yr old son loves this show!
1,"not terrible, but not great from an adult perspective....much more for kids"
1,Great show can be watched time and again.
1,The best!
1,Classic!
1,very interesting movie
1,"I just love this show! I myself went through a lot of what these kids are experiencing, but I didn't have understanding adults around to help me through it and to understand.what was actually happening to me!<br />At least these children are getting the compassionate belief and guidance they so desperately need!"
1,Good movie well acted and well written
1,Blissfully exciting!!  All about commitment. Characters are richly and interestingly complex. Waiting for more. Thanks Amazon
1,I was mesmerized.  This movie is truly a gem.
0,It was ok
1,"Really enjoyed it, hard to find good comedy without all the filthy language. It requires talent and this lady has it."
1,"I'm only part way through this season. . .so far I still love the characters and continuing story line, however the story lines have gotten a bit strange at times.  Really outer limits, no pun intended.  But know with story after story after story, it must get extremely hard in trying not to just redo or remake a show about Star Trek in its entirety and where it's been, seen, and conquered."
0,boring
1,"This movie definitely creeps me out; I watch a LOT of horror films but I'm rarely unsettled by them. Seen this one twice and enjoyed it both times--if having a knot in your stomach counts as &#34;enjoyment&#34;, that is."
0,Predictable
1,"Became infatuated with Mads Mikkelsen in Hannibal. He did such a brilliant acting job in that show I decided I could survive a subtitled movie if he was the star. It was a very powerful performance of a very difficult subject. Would recommend this brilliant drama to anyone, English speaking or otherwise."
1,It was entertaining and actually thought it was more comedic than anything.  Definitely a different take on the Lone Ranger.
1,"Every single episode is full of drama and touching family situations,  A five star season.  Bring on season 7."
1,Great movie
1,One of my favorites!
0,Worst movie ever
1,Awesome movie!! Can and will watch it over and over.
1,"What's not to like?  Wierd Al Yankovic, Michael Richards (before Seinfeld) and such quotable lines as, &#34;Wheel of Fish&#34;, &#34;Conan the Librarian&#34; and &#34;Turtles are nature's suction cups&#34;.  Grab a brewsky, put your feet up and enjoy."
1,Very Interesting.  Holds your attention to all the details of the battle.
1,Excellent streaming quality
1,Getting kind of out there but still good.
1,Really deep
0,"Waste of money, and my time watching it! Worst one yet! That's my opinion of it!"
0,Movie would not load
1,It is awesome. Fairy tales for adults... not that the originals weren't violent and crazy before Disney got his hands on them. ...
0,"This was not the movie, I wanted to see. I could have been ok with that, but this movie sucked."
1,This is amazing for kids.  I refuse to let my granddaughter watch barney I'm so sick of him.  But this is more comparable to blue's clue but better.
1,"Good movie. Exactly what I expected. It's a very typical Expendables movie so if you have seen the first two, this one is very similar. Not going to win any awards, but its an entertaining guy flick."
1,"It was ok, somewhat weak in context."
1,Cute show
1,Best grown-up comedy in a long long time. As good as Frankie and Grace
1,Great movie.
1,"This movie was NUTS. I loved it. Totally goofy, shows the weird attitude Japan has towards sexuality, and then at the end a twist."
0,"Pretty good, though I can't help comparing the scene where she goes into the bathroom to disrobe and clean off with a similar scene in Open Range.  One woman was &#34;come hitherish&#34; and the other &#34;proper,&#34; though she clearly had interest in the man who caught her redressing.Why do they have to jump into bed? Kevin Costner and Annette Benning were circumspect and it added suspense and interest to their characters."
1,Loved this movie.  Keaton and Freeman make a great couple.  Loved the feelings and love that came through in this movie.
1,It was an ok movie. A bit cheesy and predictable. It was a very surface movie. You get what you see. Nothing in the movie makes you think too hard.
1,This was an outstanding documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
1,My  nearly 4-year-old granddaughter really enjoyed this movie. Just scary enough for some plot interest without overwhelming her. I think she picked &#34;Sara&#34; as her particular favorite. Good to watch girls having adventures right along with the boys.
1,Love retro!
1,Season 2 really picks up on the story and develops the characters relationships. Never a boring episode!
1,Love Justified! One of the best shows I have watched. My husband and I are glad that I happened upon it!
1,Learned a lot about him !!
1,excellent story.  I appreciate her willingness to share.
1,OK movie
1,"I'm a lawyer but a solo practitioner.  The experiences of associates in a large firm seem to jibe with what I am told.  The need to have high billable hours and to keep clients happy is a requirement for a high salary.  The attractiveness of the women (be it lawyers, administrative assistants or paralegals) is unrealistic but that part of the reason the audience watches."
1,Great show
1,Surprisingly good!
1,I love this season.
1,A great storyline but slow moving and an &#34;unfinished&#34; ending:-(
1,"A classic Western, very good."
1,Great
1,Overall good show. Too much cursing though.
1,"Best movie I've seen Al Pacino in in awhile.  He really embraced playing Danny Collins.  Good acting too by Benning, Garner, Cannavale & Plummer."
1,"Gripping, visually first-class and totally underrated..."
0,"Annoyingly random, marginally funny, chaotically inconsistent, and would be much more entertaining if watched in the same condition the writers must have been in when they wrote the screenplay. Too late now."
1,I love all of it.
1,ðŸ‘ðŸ˜‚
1,Good documentary on one battle during the war in Afghanistan
1,This show is so funny and it kept me in stitches!
1,Watched on an airplane and caught myself laughing out loud with headphones on!! Lol got some funny looks!! Great for some good laughs
1,One of the better sci-fi TV shows.  It stays interesting and keeps me engrossed.  It's become one of my favorites.  It's far better than Under the Dome.  I hope this gets renewed for another season.
1,Love the show.  Actors are great.
1,Very Funny. One of my new favorites!
1,"Want to see more of this Mini Series, When is Season 4 coming???"
1,Kids love it!
1,"I got bored and turned the TV off after 20 minutes of the very first episode. I am so glad that I tried again, because I have totally enjoyed every episode. Season two gets more involved in the deep personal issues of the key characters on both sides. All I ask for from my TV is to take me away for a while. I certainly would not want to be in any of these characters' life situations, but it's fun to watch it.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that are offended by the sex and language. I have been repulsed by other shows, but this is not gratuitous sex, it is integral to the plot."
0,silly and boring!!!!
1,"Very good movie, we enjoyed it."
1,Miller has topped all previous films
1,Love it.
1,"Growing up I loved the song &#34;The Rain The Park and Other Things&#34; , but I was never really into the band.  I was more a fan of groups like The Beatles and Rolling Stones. I recently saw The Cowsills perform with The Happy Together Tour and then became curious as to their &#34;story&#34;.  I enjoyed this documentary very much.  I discovered that I am the same age as Susan but with only one older brother. She was fortunate to have so many. It made me sad to hear of yet another controlling father and husband. That was so typical of that era.  I am sad for all the losses they went through but happy that Paul, Susan and Bob are still playing together.  I'm glad I got to see the three of them perform and hear their story.  Whether you are a fan or not I think you will enjoy seeing this documentary."
1,Kind of distracting with all the stories at beginning but picked up as it moved along.
1,Awesome movie with a nice tribute to Paul Walker.
1,"Excellent film, enough said"
1,"My third viewing of this excellent series.  This time, I was introducing the show to my granddaughter."
1,"Great western classic with lessons in good character, civic duty, and morality just to mention a few."
1,Good movie
1,Love it!
1,"I'm a nanny for two girls, age 6 and 3.  This is their new favorite show.  They were so excited when we found it."
1,We loved it . So glad it is coming back for another season.
1,great
1,The first seasons were better some of this season was a bit cheesy
1,I loved this one episode and am hoping it will continue as a long term series.
1,We were late getting on to how good this series is. We are using Amazon to work our way through and are up to season 6. We don't know what we will do when we run out of episodes since we usually watch at least two a night.
1,Touching movie and a tribute to our military
1,loved it
0,Not a very good movie.  I gave it 2 stars because I was able to sit through the whole thing.
1,Ditto.
1,"Simply put, the best animated series of the last decade. An absolute must see for lovers of martial arts, magic, anime, or simply people who love a good story!"
1,It's pretty pretty pretty pretty good!
1,Great old action western-- Enjoyed it!
1,very nice movie
1,Hilarious!  Well done!
1,"Vegas, our current most watched series on TV is fun, tongue in cheek, great cast, and keeps us wanting more.  Not quite up to JUSTIFIED, but a close second."
1,Love it!!
1,The first episode felt like ABC family drama meets the walking dead. its not terrible and still has potential. we will see where it goes from here.
1,"Great suspense drama.  Love the shows, they all provide great information on government and the criminals."
0,Terrible
1,Totally Classic.
0,First of all I don't understand the title.  Secondly I love Keira Knightly in almost evetything I've seen her in. But this movie was beneath her ability and I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone. I initially watched it to see if my granddaughters 10 + 13 could watch it. Absolutely not. Waste of time.
1,a good mystery story with some good humor thrown in.
0,they should have stopped at the first movie.
1,"Interesting, if too predictable. The characters were not adequately developed. Del Toro delivers but the protagonist, while appealing, was 2.5 dimensional. Enjoyable film, however, especially for its take on the period in Columbia and Escobar's power."
1,Can't wait for the next season!
1,francesca never ate her rock.......
1,Classic 1980s LA
1,"Love the development of the story from first season. If you like sci-fi, this is your show!"
1,Awkwardly dark and hilarious.
1,"Great Movie!  Loved it! Funny, intriguing, heart warming."
1,"Liked it, unexpected."
1,The story is old with a little different .....I enjoy this version I will follow for now.
0,"Ok, but not great!"
0,Terrible
1,Great season of the walking dead. You will not be disappointed. I has spoilers so I will not give anything away. Season 3 is a MUST see!
1,Love suits
0,Stay away - Money grab for Will Smith
0,I just could not relate to this movie.  Did not finish watching it.
1,"Very intriguing storyline.  Movie could have been done better.  Hard to keep up with past and present. Overall, enjoyable movie."
1,"Some great special effects. You see that the Flying Fortress is anything but. As parts of the plane disappear to the flak, and bullets zipping by all the time, I am  glad I was in the navy. :-)"
1,"I am still watching it and to be honest. it is only because I have been watching it that I want to finish. This was another Spartacus, 300 attempt in making something lasting, however the characters are not developing at all. This series has a good idea of what it wants, but no idea on how to get their. The only character worth enjoying is Daedalus the Inventor. Every other character is mediocre at best. This series was a let down, no surprise there, only because it seems to be trying to hard to become something it will never be with that type of cast. it has a very long way to go and I don't think it will get there. This series needs better actors and better plots and storylines. The main character is not even believable. Sorry guys better luck on another series."
1,A very thought provoking movie about what are the basic rules that constitute life.
1,Best time to watch is at night. And I know one of the people who acts in this film. She has come a long way. Cool person to know!
0,"One and done.  Acting, characters and particularly the plot are stilted and wooden, clearly not anywhere near par for what I'd expect for series produced within the last 3-4 years.  No more needs be said.  There are a plethora of excellent series available so there's simply no need to try and tough this one out."
1,Had my attention from start to finish.  Great movie!
1,"Good,"
1,very good touched my hart.
1,It was great!
1,"We liked it!! Please make more, what a shame there was only one. A likable character, yes a criminal but likable. The premise is fresh and interesting. Make more"
1,This is the best show ever!!! Our twins love it! Our 18 month old asks for &#34;Timmy&#34; all day!!!!!
1,"Generally speaking, this is an original plot and, despite the unlikely premise of advanced aliens surviving in the form of spores that can mate/hybridize with human DNA, pretty realistic and very gripping.  My biggest and minor complaint about the realism is when they had Molly supposedly hitting 4 bullseyes with the pistol after never having fired one before.  The characters, including that of Ethan the Android Humanich son , JD the former cop, and .Molly Woods (played by Halle Berry), the former astronaut and now hybrid, are all interesting.        After watching all 11 episodes of Season 2, I am even more impressed than after season 1.  Several actors/actresses and their characters were very engaging.  The projections of future technology in Extant ,which appears to be at least 20 years into the future,such as even more ubiquitous surveillance and recording of everything and the quantum leap in AI were all believable.  The intelligence shown by the World Threat Assessment master computer and the humanichs--androids with the very nearly exact appearence of humans--is very impressive but not so extreme as to be ridiculous or even highly unlikely.  I liked the profile of the hybrid human-aliens as being generally peaceful but with some hostility to humans.  The escape of the alien spores containing the DNA of an alien race about to be wiped out from some unspecified global catastrophe and then by infecting/mating with humans--is a pretty imaginative mutation on the familiar Superman/Supergirl escape from Krypton.   Among the more progressie,non-male-chauvanist high points in character development, was the roughly 60 year-old woman Secretary of HomeSec, the future Dept. of Homeland Security, Fiona Stanton, played by Kate Burton, who was an earthy, tough boss every bit as intimidating as a macho male boss would be, yet a fair person.  While there may be a minor problem with some perhaps gratuitous sex thrown in such as in the ubiquitous cleavage displayed by Berry, which is a good hook for heterosexual males, Berry succeeds in evoking a wide and deep range of emotion, ranging from wisecracking to extreme anger and irespressible independance to great sadness and affection.  Although JD Richter, the detective and on-demand cop played by J Dean , was initially a bit off-putting with his loose sexual behavior, he  progressively is shown to be a very good and honest human being with courage and whose &#34;problem with authority&#34; helps Molly to be able to escape from the federal /global authorities trying to stop her from figuring out and revealing how the alien invasion/landing has inadvertantly led to what looks like murders of young pregnant women.  His down-to-earth detective skills is a realistic and welcome departure from all the cyber-sleuthing that is the predominant form of investigation/intelligence in this future world."
1,Great slasher psycho thriller
1,Absolutely captivating
0,I don't see the point... Felt like a power rangers episode blah.
0,totally unrealistic.
1,Great book for my summer redading assignment ( 8th grade)
1,Beautiful! Storyline was awesome. Have godzilla a soul.
1,"This is a pretty good series.  It does suffer from being overly preachy and having a pro-Democrat bias, but it is nice to see a show which seeks to highlight positive values. (Compare and Contrast House of Cards!)"
1,"Great acting, inventive scripts, great production value, the legal evolution of Boston Legal which took a leap over Paper Chase."
1,"This tv series about a law enforcement career family (3 generations) is intriguing. There is a common thread from one episode to another, but a different story each time."
1,"This is a brutally honest film about what often happens when a group of women is isolated.  Without studs, twisted, wanton lust eventually becomes the obsession of all.  Based on actual university experiments, this work explores one of the more important parts of what it means to be a woman."
1,mirren is great
1,Worth the watch.
1,A lot different than what I expected. The first episode was a bit slow but I think the series will pick up. I'm looking forward to the other episodes.
1,"A hilarious movie,  that is great to watch especially after a difficult day. The characters are winsome.  A little bit of crude humor, but it is standard for this type of movie."
1,"I think you are missing one possible technology that I am working on. Instead of improving human I am trying to build a digital consciousness exclusively for digital entity that can perform one main function better than humans individually or collective. Personalized tutoring is one example, there are more. For me I need to know what are the brain/ mind functions  regional area such as the Pons or limbic system,<br />Then these functions can be designed in current IT  technology. In the future if we can extract the neural patterns  from one brain for learning a concept, we will then be enabled to share these learning experience patterns by transmitting these function directly to a concerned region of brain .. Then Voila, instant learning .this is showed in the Matrix movies as science fiction, we can make it a reality in the near future.20 - 50 years.<br />I should differentiate  between digital and Artificial conscious AC . AC has a robotics component that can be applied to kill. This is a real moral issue and I am totally against it.<br />So your technology can refocus to the new emerging Market of DC we can build super digital entities that will never harm the human race and we can also augment the cognitive abilities such as awareness and learning with no more moral issues.<br />Hassan Khorshid"
1,Very funny.  Very good movie.
1,I'm in love with Kelly McDonald
1,Excellent documentary. The film provides insight about our fire problem today and the difficulty in doing anything about it.
1,"Enjoyed the movie. Glad that she stayed, just didn't care for the way it ended"
1,Amazing!
1,"Phenomenal writing, interesting plot twists, but started reaching near the end...would have like to have seen a more appropriate exit for Dandy..."
1,Interesting series.  We'll casted.
1,"I was most pleasantly surprised.  I was led to believe that it was mainly a historical movie about my hometown, Albany, NY.  It was filmaed in  here, but it was a story of what people went through during that time, anywhere.  It is a great movie and worth watching."
1,Such a teaser I wanted more but only one episode. I'm sure more will follow soon I hope.
0,Terrible effects
0,Kind of an odd movie.  I would have liked it better if the movie would have ended differently
1,Giovanni Ribisi is the only person they could've cashed in this role. He is fantastic. I love the tension with the grandmother. And casting Bryan Cranston is the kingpin is genius.
1,When do we get season nine?
1,Beautiful scenery nicely done
1,The acting is excellent.
1,Watched it with our 23 year old daughter and we all loved it!
0,"Rotten movie.  Amazon gave it 6 stars.  I wouldn't give it one.  Also the sound track was off.  The pictures were behind the dialog by a few seconds.  Very disconcerting.  Besides the technical glitch, the plot was stupid, where were that lead girl's parents.  The whole thing was a waste of time and &#34;Rotten Tomatoes&#34; gave the best review about why this movie is a total flop."
1,"One of the classics. It is in my top 10 all-time favorites. Donald Sutherland is awesome, he play's a great character. This has an all star cast.  Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, and more. See if you can recognize the Captain of the Love Boat. He has a great roll it this film too. Hope you enjoy the movie."
1,"What a great fun romp of a romantic comedy - and much more - with a wonderful score - lively, engaging, great performances!"
1,"This show makes me laugh A LOT . Improvised comedy of errors. Excellent, intelligent writing. Quirky.  Lots of cameos from recognizable actors and people in show business. Creative. It's sort of like a &#34;Seinfeld for Mature Audiences Only&#34;..  The main character is a cross between Woody Allen and George Costanza. This show is very funny."
1,My 2 year old daughter loves Caillou she can watch it everyday all day and never get tired of watching it!!
1,Love this show
1,My son loves this show.

0,Not good. After watching this I asked myself why did I pay to see this and why did I waste my time!!
1,Colin Farrell is at his best in this sweet romantic movie.

1,"My grandboys (3.5 years and 1.5 years) fell in love with this program. Held their attention for hours...not that we watched it for hours on end, but it was on the the entire 5 hours they were here.  The 3.5 year old never once requested a channel change!!  Awesome program for a child's dreams and imagination!!"
1,scary
1,Great production. Sad outcome.
1,Descent.
1,Great fun dry humor and plenty of action.  Cant wait to watch the next season.
1,"Enjoying the story line, ready for the next and final movie in the series.  Pretty powerful performance by many cast members."
1,Enjoyed season 1 very much. Looking forward to season 2.
1,"Worth watching for Fiennes' performance. He is as compelling as he would go on to be in Schindler's List and the remake of Red Dragon.  Binoche is less successfully cast as Cathy. French accent gets in the way and her part could have been better written. The wonderful Janet McTeer is wasted on this Nelly Dean, reduced here to a bit of a cipher. If you really want the full Wuthering experience, McTeer's reading of the book available on Audible is not to be missed.  The book is hellishly difficult to capture well on film. It is much darker, and the psychology of the characters much more complex, than even this version conveys, and it does try. Some have praised the music. I thought it cliched, over the top and intrusive."
1,It's good started a little slow I'll probably watch more of it
1,Season 2 was even better than Season 1. The writers managed to draw you into the characters lives even deeper.  I can't wait to view Season 3 now.
